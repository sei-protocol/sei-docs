# Contributing to the Docs

## Quick Start

Ensure you have `yarn` installed (macOS users can Run `brew install yarn`)

1. Use `yarn` to install dependencies
2. Use `yarn dev` to run the docs locally.
3. Use `yarn build` to build the docs.

You should always run `yarn build` before pushing any changes to validate that there are no syntax errors.

## Contributing

This documentation is created using [Nextra](https://nextra.site).

### Structure

Each page is generated from a single `.mdx` file under the `./pages` directory.

Each directory represents a page grouping. Each directory contains a `_meta.json` file, which dictates the order and name of the items in the navbar.

For more information on how the docs are structured, please refer to the [Nextra docs](https://nextra.site/docs/guide).

### Changing Content

All content submitted will be reviewed by a maintainer

To standardize the documentation, please follow the [style guide](https://github.com/sei-protocol/sei-docs/blob/devrel/STYLE_GUIDE.mdx) for instructions on how to format changes to the docs.
