# NFT Contract Tutorial

## Introduction

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are unique digital assets, each possessing distinct
identities and attributes. Unlike fungible tokens created by the Token Factory,
NFTs cannot be exchanged on a like-for-like basis.

<Nfts />

This tutorial guides you through the creation and deployment of an NFT contract
on Sei. By the end, you'll have deployed your own NFT contract. Select one of
the tabs below to get started!

<Tabs items={["EVM", "CosmWasm"]}>
<Tabs.Tab>

In this section, we'll use Foundry to deploy an ERC-721 contract to the Ethereum
network. ERC-721 is a standard for NFT contracts on Ethereum. Learn more about
ERC-721 [here](https://erc721.org/).

## Requirements

Before we start, ensure you have:

- Installed Foundry. Follow the
  [installation guide](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation).
- A basic understanding of Solidity and smart contract development.
- A wallet with SEI tokens on devnet

<Callout type="info">You can obtain devnet tokens from one of the faucets listed [here](../dev-ecosystem-providers/faucets).</Callout>

## Setting Up Your Project

1. Initialize a new Foundry project:

   ```bash
   forge init my-nft-project
   cd my-nft-project
   ```

2. Install OpenZeppelin, a library for secure smart contract development.

   ```bash
   forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts
   ```

3. Create a new Solidity file under `src/` for your NFT contract, e.g.,
   `MyNFT.sol`.

## Writing the ERC-721 Contract

1. In `src/MyNFT.sol`, start by importing OpenZeppelin's ERC-721 implementation:

   ```solidity copy
    // contracts/MyNFT.sol
    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
    pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

    import {ERC721} from "openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";

    contract MyNFT is ERC721 {
        constructor() ERC721("MyNFT", "MNFT") {
        }
    }
   ```

<Callout type="info" >
You may see an error in your IDE about importing `openzeppelin-contracts`. To
resolve this, run this command to create `remapping.txt` in the root of your
project:

```bash
forge remappings > remappings.txt
```

</Callout>

2. Add any additional functions or overrides necessary for your NFT.

## Testing Your Contract

1. Write tests for your contract in the `test/` directory.
2. Run your tests with:

   ```bash
   forge test
   ```

## Deploying Your Contract

1. Compile your contract:

   ```bash
   forge build
   ```

2. Deploy your contract to a local testnet (e.g., using Anvil, Foundry's local
   Ethereum node):

   ```bash
   anvil -a 1
   ```

   **Flags**

   - `-a`: flag specifies the number of test accounts to create. This command
     will start a local Ethereum node and create one account. In the command
     output you will see created account and its private key. Use this private
     key to deploy your contract.

   In a new terminal, deploy your contract:

   ```bash
   forge create --rpc-url http://localhost:8545 --private-key <test_account_private_key> src/MyNFT.sol:MyNFT --legacy
   ```

   **Flags**

   - `--rpc-url`: flag to specify the URL of the Ethereum node. In this case,
     it's the URL of the local Anvil node.
   - `--private-key`: flag to specify the private key of the account that will
     deploy the contract. Anvil generated test account's private key is used in
     this case.

3. Deploy contract to the Sei devnet (EVM endpoint):

   ```bash
   forge create --rpc-url https://evm-rpc.arctic-1.seinetwork.io/ --private-key <your_private_key> src/MyNFT.sol:MyNFT --legacy
   ```

   **Flags**

   - `--rpc-url`: flag to specify the URL of the Ethereum node. In this case,
     it's the Sei EVM devnet URL.
   - `--private-key`: flag to specify the private key of the account that will
     deploy the contract. The private key of your account on the Sei devnet is
     used in this case.

<Callout type="info">Make sure to have SEI in your account to cover the gas fees for contract deployment.</Callout>

## Interacting With Your NFT

- You can interact with your deployed NFT contract using Foundry's `cast` tool
  or through other tools like Ethers.js in a script or web application.

## Create Pointer Contract

To enable seamless use of this NFT contract in CosmWasm environments, you can
create a pointer contract. This process results in an CW721 token that can be
imported and used in Sei wallets and applications.

```bash
seid tx evm register-cw-pointer ERC721 $ERC721_TOKEN_ADDRESS --from $ACCOUNT --chain-id=arctic-1 --fees=25000usei --node=https://rpc-arctic-1.sei-apis.com/
```

**Parameters**

- `ERC721_TOKEN_ADDRESS`: The contract address of the ERC721 token you want to
  create an CW721 pointer for.

**Flags**

- `--from`: The Sei address from which the deployment transaction is sent. This
  address must have enough balance to cover transaction fees.
- `--label`: A name for the contract instance used to identify the contract.
- `--chain-id`: Identifies the specific chain of the Sei network you're
  interacting with. `arctic-1` refers to the Sei devnet.
- `--broadcast-mode`: Determines how the transaction is broadcasted. Setting
  this to `block` means the transaction will wait to be included in a block
  before returning a response.
- `--gas`: Specifies the maximum amount of gas that can be consumed by the
  transaction.
- `--fees`: Indicates the transaction fee.
- `--node`: Points to the specific Sei node RPC URL you're connecting to for
  transaction submission.
- `--no-admin`: Specifies that the contract should not have an admin. This flag
  is used to indicate that the contract, once deployed, cannot be upgraded or
  migrated.

Executing this command creates an CW721 NFT contract and outputs the contract
address. This NFT contract is linked to the ERC721 NFT contract, meaning any
activities involving CW721 NFTs will also reflect on the state of the ERC721
NFTs and vice versa.

In this section, we'll be deploying a CW721 contract, a standard for NFTs in the
CosmWasm ecosystem. For more about CW721, visit
[here](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-nfts/blob/main/packages/cw721/README.md).

## Requirements

Before starting, ensure you have:

- **`seid` CLI**: The Sei command-line interface tool, for interacting with the
  blockchain.
- **Wallet with SEI tokens on devnet**: Contains SEI tokens for transaction
  fees.
- **Rust Programming Environment**: Install Rust for CosmWasm contract
  development. Installation guide
  [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
- **Understanding of CosmWasm**: Familiarize yourself with CosmWasm smart
  contracts. Start with the [CosmWasm Book](https://book.cosmwasm.com/).
- **Docker**: Required for using the CosmWasm Rust Optimizer tool. Install from
  [Docker's official website](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

## Setting Up Your Environment

To work with CosmWasm smart contracts, you'll need the Wasm rust compiler
installed to build Wasm binaries. To install it, run:

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

Next, clone the `CW721-base` contract from the
[cw-nfts](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-nfts) repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-nfts.git
cd cw-nfts/contracts/cw721-base
```

To test your setup, run:

```bash
cargo test
```

You should see that everything in the repository gets compiled and all tests
pass.

## Customizing the Contract

Review and modify the `cw721-base` contract to meet your requirements. This
might include updating metadata structures or changing the minting process.

## Build the Contract

To build the contract, run:

```bash
cargo wasm
```

This compiles a Wasm binary for uploading to Sei.

<Callout type="info">Note: The generated Wasm file will be located in the root directory of the `cw-nfts` repository, not in the `cw721-base` subdirectory. Make sure to navigate to the root directory to see your compiled `.wasm` file in `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/`.</Callout>

Before we can upload the contract to the chain, we have to use the
[CosmWasm Rust Optimizer](https://github.com/CosmWasm/rust-optimizer) to reduce
the contract size. While not required, this is highly recommended for live
contracts.

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/code \
  --mount type=volume,source="$(basename "$(pwd)")_cache",target=/target \
  --mount type=volume,source=registry_cache,target=/usr/local/cargo/registry \
  cosmwasm/optimizer:0.15.0 ./contracts/cw721-base/
```

This will generate an optimized Wasm contract in `/artifacts`.

<Callout type="warning">If you're using a Mac M1 machine, you might need to use the Arm 64-bit optimizer. However, it's important to note that the native Arm version generates wasm artifacts that differ from those produced by the Intel version. For production environments, we strongly recommend building contracts with the Intel optimizers to ensure reliability. Learn more [here](https://github.com/CosmWasm/rust-optimizer).</Callout>

## Deploy the Contract

Upload your contract:

```bash
seid tx wasm store artifacts/cw721_base.wasm --from=$ACCOUNT --chain-id=arctic-1 --node=https://rpc.arctic-1.seinetwork.io/ --broadcast-mode=block --gas=5000000 --fees=500000usei
```

Replace `$ACCOUNT` with your account name or address. This command stores the
contract on the chain and outputs a code ID.

<Callout type="info">For detailed descriptions of these arguments, use `seid help` in the CLI.</Callout>

Instantiate your contract using the code ID:

```bash
seid tx wasm instantiate $CONTRACT_CODE_ID '{"name":"$COLLECTION_NAME", "symbol":"$SYMBOL"}' --from=$ACCOUNT --admin=$ADMIN_ADDRESS --label=$LABEL --chain-id=arctic-1 --node=https://rpc.arctic-1.seinetwork.io/ --broadcast-mode=block --gas=250000 --fees=25000usei
```

Replace `$CONTRACT_CODE_ID`, `$ACCOUNT`, `$LABEL`, and `$ADMIN_ADDRESS`
appropriately. Successful instantiation will provide the NFT contract address.

- `$CONTRACT_CODE_ID`: Code ID of the uploaded contract (can be found in the
  output of the previous `store` command)
- `$COLLECTION_NAME`: Name of the collection
- `$SYMBOL`: Symbol of the collection
- `$ACCOUNT`: Your account name or address
- `$LABEL`: Any label for easy identification, can be used to look up the
  contract in future
- `$ADMIN_ADDRESS` (Optional): Address that will have administrative privileges
  over the contract, such as the ability to upgrade it

## Create Pointer Contract

To enable seamless use of this NFT contract in EVM environments, you can create
a pointer contract. This process results in an ERC721 token that can be imported
and used in EVM wallets and applications.

```bash
seid tx evm deploy-erccw721 $CW721_TOKEN_ADDRESS $NAME $SYMBOL --from=$SENDER --evm-rpc=https://evm-rpc.arctic-1.seinetwork.io/
```

**Parameters**

- `CW721_TOKEN_ADDRESS`: The contract address of the CW721 NFT you want to
  create an ERC721 pointer for.
- `NAME`: The name you want to assign to your ERC721 pointer token. This should
  match the name from the CW721 NFT.
- `SYMBOL`: The symbol for your ERC721 pointer token. This should match the
  symbol from the CW721 NFT.

**Flags**

- `--from`: The Sei address from which the deployment transaction is sent. This
  address must have enough balance to cover transaction fees.
- `--evm-rpc`: The endpoint URL for the EVM RPC interface of the Sei blockchain.
  This URL is used by the `seid` command to interact with the Sei EVM.

Executing this command creates an ERC721 NFT contract and outputs the contract
address. This NFT contract is linked to the CW721 NFT contract, meaning any
activities involving CW721 NFTs will also reflect on the state of the ERC721
NFTs and vice versa.
