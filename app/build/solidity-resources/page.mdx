# Solidity Resources

Most development resources for developing with Soldity on Ethereum Mainnet also apply to development on Sei.

This page suggests a minimal set of resources for getting started with building a decentralized app for Sei EVM.

- **[Uniswap](https://github.com/Uniswap)**  
  A professional, easy-to-digest smart contract of the [Uniswap V2 pools](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core) that gives an overview of an in-production Solidity dApp. A guided walkthrough is available [here](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/tutorials/uniswap-v2-annotated-code/). For the more advanced Uniswap Pools, check out the Uniswap V3 [here](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core) and Uniswap V4 [here](https://github.com/Uniswap/v4-core).
- **[Rareskills Blog](https://www.rareskills.io/category/solidity)**  
  Features in-depth articles on various Solidity concepts and their [Book of Gas Optimization](https://www.rareskills.io/post/gas-optimization).
- **[Foundry Fundamentals course by Cyfrin Updraft](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/courses/foundry)**  
  A comprehensive web3 development course covering Foundry—the industry-standard framework for building, deploying, and testing smart contracts.
- **[Smart Contract Programmer YT channel](https://www.youtube.com/@smartcontractprogrammer)**  
  Contains many in-depth videos covering topics from ABI encoding to EVM memory management.

## Advanced Solidity

- **[Solmate repository](https://github.com/transmissions11/solmate)** and **[Solady repository](https://github.com/Vectorized/solady)**  
  Gas-optimized contracts using Solidity or Yul.
- **[Yul](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/yul.html)**  
  An intermediate language for Solidity, akin to inline assembly for the EVM, offering control flow constructs while exposing low-level memory management.
- **[Advanced Foundry course by Cyfrin Updraft](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/courses/advanced-foundry)**  
  Teaches advanced smart contract development including building DeFi protocols, stablecoins, DAOs, and more.
- **[Smart Contract Security course by Cyfrin Updraft](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/courses/security)**
