# How To Stake SEI Tokens

#### **Prerequisites:**

- You need SEI tokens in a **native Sei wallet** (not EVM)

- If your tokens are on the EVM side, [bridge them first](https://markdowntohtml.com/Bridging/01-native-evm-bridge.md)

#### **Method 1: Using SeiScan**

- Visit [SeiScan](https://www.seiscan.app/)

- Connect your **Keplr wallet** or other Cosmos wallet

- Navigate to the **"Staking"** tab

- Browse the validator list and click on a validator you want to delegate to

- Click **"Delegate"**

- Enter the **amount** of SEI you want to stake

- Review transaction details and click **"Submit"**

- Approve the transaction in your wallet

#### **Method 2: Using Keplr Extension**

- Open the **Keplr browser extension**

- Select **"Sei"** from the network dropdown

- Click on the **"Stake"** button

- Select a validator from the list

- Enter the **amount** to delegate

- Click **"Delegate"** and approve the transaction

#### **Method 3: Using Third-Party Staking Platforms**

Several platforms offer user-friendly staking interfaces, such as:

- [Restake.app](https://restake.app/sei)

- [Cosmostation](https://wallet.cosmostation.io/)

- [Leap Wallet](https://www.leapwallet.io/)

Follow their respective interfaces to connect your wallet and stake SEI.

### Explanation & Tips

#### Staking Rewards

- Current network reward rate is approximately **X%** annually (varies with network conditions)

- Rewards are automatically accumulated and can be claimed manually

- Staking rewards are subject to the validator's commission rate (typically 1-10%)

#### Validator Selection Considerations

- **Commission Rate**: Lower commission means more rewards for you

- **Voting Power**: Prefer validators with lower voting power to improve network decentralization

- **Uptime/Performance**: Check for validators with high uptime (99%+)

- **Governance Participation**: Consider validators who actively participate in governance

#### Unbonding Period

- SEI has a **7-day unbonding period**

- During unbonding, your tokens are **locked** (cannot be transferred or used)

- You **do not earn rewards** during the unbonding period

#### Claiming Rewards

- Visit [SeiScan](https://www.seiscan.app/) or use Keplr

- Navigate to the staking section

- Look for "Claim Rewards" button

- You can claim from all validators at once or individually

### Common Questions

**Q: Can I stake from my EVM wallet (MetaMask)?**
A: No, staking is only available on the native Sei chain. You must first bridge your tokens from EVM to native Sei.

**Q: Is there a minimum amount required for staking?**
A: While there is no enforced minimum, very small amounts may result in transaction fees outweighing rewards. Consider staking at least 10 SEI.

**Q: What happens if my chosen validator gets slashed?**
A: A portion of your staked tokens (currently up to 5%) could be slashed if your validator misbehaves. This is why validator selection is important.

**Q: Can I move my stake between validators?**
A: Yes, you can redelegate your stake to a different validator without waiting for the unbonding period. However, you can only redelegate from the same validator once every 7 days.
