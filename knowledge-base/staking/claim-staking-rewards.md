- Alternatively, find a specific validator and click **"Claim"** next to their entry

- Review the transaction details and click **"Submit"**

- Approve the transaction in your wallet

#### **Method 2: Using Keplr Extension**

- Select **"Sei"** from the network dropdown

### Explanation & Tips

#### Reward Accumulation

- Staking rewards accumulate **automatically** with each block

- You don't need to claim frequently - rewards continue to grow whether claimed or not

- Rewards are not automatically compounded (re-staked) unless you use auto-compound services

#### Gas Fees Consideration

- Claiming rewards requires a transaction fee

- If you have small rewards across many validators, consider waiting until the rewards are larger

- Claiming from multiple validators in one transaction is more gas-efficient than individual claims

#### Auto-Compounding Options

- Some validators offer **REStake** services, which automatically claim and re-stake your rewards

- This requires granting permission to the validator

- You can configure this on platforms that allow for it.

#### After Claiming

- Claimed rewards will be added to your **available balance** (not automatically re-staked)

- You can then choose to:

Stake these rewards again

- Transfer them elsewhere

- Bridge them to EVM

- Hold them in your wallet

### Common Questions

**Q: How often should I claim my rewards?**
A: This depends on your staking amount. For smaller amounts (under 100 SEI), claiming monthly or quarterly is reasonable. For larger amounts, weekly claiming might make sense.

**Q: Do rewards compound automatically?**
A: No, not by default. You need to manually claim and re-stake, or use an auto-compounding service.

**Q: Are there tax implications for claiming rewards?**
A: In many jurisdictions, staking rewards may be considered income at the time they're claimed. Consult a tax professional for advice specific to your situation.

**Q: What happens to unclaimed rewards if I unstake?**
A: When you initiate unbonding, any unclaimed rewards should be claimed first. Some interfaces automatically prompt you to claim rewards when unstaking.
