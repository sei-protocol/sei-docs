# How can my EVM contract look up associated addresses or trigger address association?

Sei provides an **Address Precompile** at `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001004` specifically for managing the link between Sei Native (`sei1...`) and EVM (`0x...`) addresses derived from the same private key.

**Key Functions (Solidity Interface):**

```
interface ISeiAddressPrecompile {
 // --- View Functions ---

 /**
 * @notice Gets the associated Sei Bech32 address for a given EVM address.
 * @param evmAddr The EVM address (`0x...`) to look up.
 * @return seiAddr The associated Sei address string (`sei1...`). Reverts if not associated.
 */
 function getSeiAddr(address evmAddr) external view returns (string memory seiAddr);

 /**
 * @notice Gets the associated EVM address for a given Sei Bech32 address.
 * @param seiAddr The Sei address string (`sei1...`) to look up.
 * @return evmAddr The associated EVM address (`0x...`). Reverts if not associated.
 */
 function getEvmAddr(string memory seiAddr) external view returns (address evmAddr);

 // --- State Changing Functions ---

 /**
 * @notice Associates the EVM and Sei addresses derived from the signer of the provided message.
 * @dev Requires a signature created off-chain over the customMessage.
 * @param v The recovery ID (usually 27 or 28, potentially as hex string "0x1b" or "0x1c").
 * @param r The R component of the ECDSA signature (as hex string).
 * @param s The S component of the ECDSA signature (as hex string).
 * @param customMessage The exact message string that was signed.
 * @return seiAddr The associated Sei address.
 * @return evmAddr The associated EVM address.
 */
 function associate(string memory v, string memory r, string memory s, string memory customMessage) external returns (string memory seiAddr, address evmAddr);

 /**
 * @notice Associates the EVM and Sei addresses derived from a provided public key.
 * @dev The public key must be in compressed format, represented as a hex string without the "0x" prefix.
 * @param pubKeyHex The compressed public key hex string.
 * @return seiAddr The associated Sei address.
 * @return evmAddr The associated EVM address.
 */
 function associatePubKey(string memory pubKeyHex) external returns (string memory seiAddr, address evmAddr);
}

```

**How to Use:**

- **Lookups (`getSeiAddr`, `getEvmAddr`):** Call these view functions directly from your contract to find an existing association. Handle potential reverts if no association exists (e.g., using `try/catch`).

- **Association (`associate`, `associatePubKey`):** These functions *create* the on-chain link. They are typically **not called directly by end-users** from a generic contract.

The `associate` function requires an off-chain signature generated by the user's wallet, making it suitable for integration into dApp frontends or dedicated association tools.

- The `associatePubKey` function requires the user's compressed public key, which might be less common for users to handle directly.

- These functions will fail if an association already exists for the derived addresses.

**Important Considerations:**

- **Association Requirement:** Many other Sei precompiles (like Staking, IBC, Bank `send`) require the `caller` to be associated before they can be used successfully.

- **Gas Costs:** Lookup functions are cheap. Association functions (`associate`, `associatePubKey`) have a higher base gas cost (e.g., 50,000) due to cryptographic operations.

- **Security:** Association proves ownership. The `associate` function relies on cryptographic signatures for security.
