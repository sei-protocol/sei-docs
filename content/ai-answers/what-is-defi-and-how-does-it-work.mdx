## Overview

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is a set of financial applications built on public blockchains that enable activities like trading, lending, borrowing, and earning yield without relying on traditional intermediaries such as banks or brokerages. Instead of centralized control, DeFi uses smart contracts—programs that run on-chain—to enforce rules and execute transactions transparently.

## How It Works

### Smart contracts as financial infrastructure

Most DeFi applications are powered by smart contracts that define how funds move and under what conditions. Users interact with these contracts using a wallet (e.g., MetaMask), signing transactions that call contract functions.

Common building blocks include:

- **Tokens:** Digital assets (e.g., stablecoins, governance tokens) that represent value or rights.
- **Decentralized exchanges (DEXs):** Protocols that let users swap tokens without a centralized order book operator (often via automated market makers, AMMs).
- **Lending/borrowing markets:** Pools where lenders supply assets to earn interest, and borrowers take loans by posting collateral.
- **Derivatives and perpetuals:** On-chain instruments that track price exposure using margin and funding payments.
- **Yield strategies:** Automated vaults or strategies that move funds across protocols to optimize returns.

### Wallets, keys, and permissions

DeFi is typically **non-custodial**:

- Your wallet holds your private keys.
- Smart contracts hold funds according to program logic.
- Access to assets is controlled by signatures and contract permissions (allowances/approvals).

### Oracles for real-world pricing

Many DeFi systems depend on **oracles** to bring off-chain data (like asset prices) onto the blockchain. Accurate, manipulation-resistant oracle feeds are critical for:

- Liquidations in lending markets
- Derivatives settlement
- Collateral valuation

### Liquidity pools and incentives

DeFi requires liquidity to function efficiently:

- AMMs rely on **liquidity providers (LPs)** who deposit token pairs into pools.
- LPs earn fees and sometimes token incentives, but assume risks such as **impermanent loss**.
- Protocols may use incentives (rewards) to bootstrap liquidity and usage.

### Composability (“money legos”)

DeFi protocols are often composable—one protocol can integrate another:

- A vault deposits into a lending market, borrows against collateral, and supplies elsewhere.
- A DEX aggregator routes trades across multiple liquidity sources.
  This modularity accelerates innovation but can increase systemic risk when dependencies are complex.

### Key risks and considerations

DeFi benefits from openness and automation, but users should understand:

- **Smart contract risk:** Bugs or exploits can lead to loss of funds.
- **Oracle risk:** Bad pricing data can cause improper liquidations.
- **Liquidity risk:** Low liquidity can increase slippage or volatility.
- **Governance risk:** Protocol changes may affect users.
- **User error:** Sending to wrong addresses, signing malicious approvals, or interacting with fake sites.

## On Sei Network

Sei is a high-performance Layer 1 designed for trading-focused and consumer-grade applications, and it supports **EVM compatibility**, allowing Solidity smart contracts and common Ethereum tooling to be used. DeFi on Sei can benefit from:

- **Parallelization:** The network is built to execute workloads efficiently, which can improve throughput for high-activity DeFi apps like DEXs and derivatives.
- **~400ms finality:** Faster finality improves the user experience for trading, liquidations, and time-sensitive strategies by reducing waiting time and uncertainty.
- **EVM compatibility:** Developers can deploy and port DeFi contracts using familiar EVM patterns and tools while taking advantage of Sei’s performance characteristics.

In practice, this means swaps, collateral updates, liquidations, and other frequent DeFi actions can feel more responsive—an important advantage for on-chain markets that depend on timely execution.

## Example: Interacting with DeFi via a Smart Contract (Solidity)

Below is a simplified example of approving a token and depositing into a DeFi “vault” contract (interfaces vary by protocol):

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

interface IERC20 {
  function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
  function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
}

interface IVault {
  function deposit(uint256 amount, address receiver) external returns (uint256 shares);
}

contract DeFiDepositor {
  function depositToVault(address token, address vault, uint256 amount) external {
    // Pull tokens from user (user must have approved this contract first)
    require(IERC20(token).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount), "transferFrom failed");

    // Approve vault to take tokens
    require(IERC20(token).approve(vault, amount), "approve failed");

    // Deposit into vault on behalf of the user
    IVault(vault).deposit(amount, msg.sender);
  }
}
```

## Example: Sending a Transaction on Sei EVM (TypeScript)

Using `ethers` to send a transaction to a DeFi contract on Sei’s EVM:

```typescript
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

const RPC_URL = process.env.SEI_EVM_RPC!;
const PRIVATE_KEY = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY!;

async function main() {
  const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(RPC_URL);
  const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(PRIVATE_KEY, provider);

  // Example: calling a vault's deposit(uint256,address)
  const vaultAddress = '0xYourVaultAddress';
  const vaultAbi = ['function deposit(uint256 amount, address receiver) returns (uint256 shares)'];
  const vault = new ethers.Contract(vaultAddress, vaultAbi, wallet);

  const amount = ethers.parseUnits('10', 6); // e.g., 10 units of a 6-decimal token
  const tx = await vault.deposit(amount, wallet.address);
  console.log('Submitted:', tx.hash);

  const receipt = await tx.wait();
  console.log('Confirmed in block:', receipt?.blockNumber);
}

main().catch((e) => {
  console.error(e);
  process.exit(1);
});
```

## Summary

DeFi is a blockchain-based financial ecosystem that replaces many traditional intermediaries with smart contracts, enabling open access to trading, lending, borrowing, and more. It works through on-chain programs, wallets, liquidity pools, and oracles, and it evolves quickly through composable protocol integrations. On Sei Network, DeFi can leverage parallelization, ~400ms finality, and EVM compatibility to support more responsive, high-throughput financial applications.
