# What is a Validator Commission and How Does It Work?

## Overview

Validator commission is the percentage of staking rewards a validator keeps as a fee for operating the validator infrastructure and providing staking services to delegators. In other words, it’s how validators get paid for running reliable nodes, managing uptime, and handling operational costs. If you’re searching **what is validator commission**, it’s essentially the validator’s “service fee” taken from rewards before the remaining rewards are distributed to delegators.

## How It Works

### Commission in Proof-of-Stake (PoS)

In PoS networks, token holders can either:

- **Run a validator** themselves, or
- **Delegate** their stake to an existing validator to participate in consensus and earn rewards.

Validators earn rewards (and may incur penalties) based on their participation in block production/validation. **Commission** defines how those earned rewards are split:

- **Validator commission rate**: the % of rewards the validator keeps.
- **Delegator rewards**: the remaining rewards after commission is deducted.

**Example**

- Network staking rewards generated: **100 tokens**
- Validator commission: **10%**
- Validator keeps: **10 tokens**
- Delegators share: **90 tokens** (distributed proportionally to their delegated stake)

### Common Commission Parameters

Most PoS staking systems track multiple commission fields:

- **Commission rate (current)**: the validator’s current fee percentage.
- **Max commission**: an upper bound the validator can never exceed.
- **Max change rate**: the maximum amount the validator can increase/decrease the commission by within a time window (often per day).

These constraints protect delegators from sudden or extreme commission hikes.

### Why Commission Exists

Validator operations come with real costs and risks:

- Hardware, hosting, and bandwidth
- Monitoring, upgrades, and security
- Key management and incident response
- Engineering/support for tooling and integrations

Commission compensates validators so they can sustainably provide reliable service.

### Commission vs. Slashing (Important Distinction)

- **Commission**: a normal fee taken from rewards.
- **Slashing / penalties**: punishment for misbehavior or downtime; can reduce stake and future rewards.

A low commission doesn’t guarantee higher net returns if the validator has poor uptime or is frequently penalized.

## On Sei Network

Sei is a high-performance Layer 1 with **fast (~400ms) finality**, **parallelized execution**, and **EVM compatibility**. Validator commission on Sei follows the familiar Cosmos-SDK-style staking model: delegators earn staking rewards, and validators take a commission from those rewards according to the validator’s commission settings.

### How Commission Affects Delegators on Sei

When you delegate SEI to a validator:

1. The validator participates in consensus and earns block rewards (and possibly other staking-related rewards).
2. The protocol calculates rewards attributable to the validator’s delegations.
3. The validator’s **commission rate** is applied to the rewards.
4. Remaining rewards are distributed to delegators based on their share of the total delegated stake.

Because Sei aims for high throughput and rapid finality, validators must maintain robust infrastructure to keep pace with the network—commission is the mechanism that funds those operational requirements.

### What to Evaluate Beyond Commission

When choosing a validator on Sei, commission is only one variable. Consider:

- **Uptime / signing performance** (missed signatures can reduce rewards and increase risk)
- **Infrastructure and operational maturity**
- **Governance participation**
- **Security posture**
- **Commission stability** (max commission and max change rate can matter as much as today’s rate)

## How to Check Validator Commission (CLI)

If you use the Sei CLI, you can query a validator and view its commission settings. Replace `<valoper_address>` with the validator operator address.

```bash
seid query staking validator <valoper_address> -o json
```

In the JSON output, look for fields similar to:

- `commission.commission_rates.rate`
- `commission.commission_rates.max_rate`
- `commission.commission_rates.max_change_rate`

You can also list validators and inspect commission values:

```bash
seid query staking validators -o json
```

## Practical Example (Understanding Net Rewards)

Assume:

- You delegate: **1,000 SEI**
- The validator earns rewards equivalent to: **12% APR**
- Validator commission: **5%**

Approximate net APR to delegator (ignoring compounding and other factors):

- Gross rewards: 12%
- Commission deducted from rewards: 5% of 12% = 0.6%
- **Estimated net**: ~11.4% APR

This is a simplification; real returns can vary with network conditions, validator performance, and reward dynamics.

## Key Takeaways

- **Validator commission** is the fee validators take from staking rewards to cover costs and earn revenue.
- Delegators receive rewards **after** commission is applied.
- On **Sei Network**, commission works within a Cosmos-style staking model while validators support Sei’s high-performance design (parallelization and ~400ms finality).
- Choosing a validator should balance **commission rate** with **reliability, security, and long-term behavior**.
