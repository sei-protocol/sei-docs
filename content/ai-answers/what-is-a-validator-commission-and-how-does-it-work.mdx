# What is a Validator Commission and How Does It Work?

## Overview

Validator commission is the fee a validator charges on staking rewards earned by their delegators. It’s expressed as a percentage (e.g., 5%) and is taken from the rewards before the remaining amount is distributed to delegators. Commission is a primary way validators cover infrastructure, operations, and risk while providing staking services.

## How It Works

### Commission in a proof-of-stake network

In delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) or PoS systems, token holders can **delegate** stake to validators. Validators participate in block production/consensus and earn rewards (and may incur penalties). Commission defines how those rewards are split:

- **Network rewards accrue** to the validator’s staking pool (validator self-bond + all delegations).
- The validator’s **commission rate** is applied to the rewards attributable to delegators.
- The validator keeps the commission portion; the remaining rewards are distributed proportionally to delegators based on their stake.

Example:

- Delegation rewards generated: `100` tokens
- Validator commission: `10%`
- Validator receives: `10` tokens (commission)
- Delegators share: `90` tokens (pro-rata)

### Commission parameters you’ll commonly see

Most Cosmos-SDK–based networks (including Sei) expose three related settings:

- **Rate**: the current commission percentage charged.
- **Max rate**: the maximum commission the validator can ever charge.
- **Max change rate**: the maximum amount the validator can increase/decrease the commission within a time window (typically per day).

These constraints protect delegators from sudden, extreme commission hikes.

### Why commission matters

Commission directly affects a delegator’s net yield, but it should be evaluated alongside validator quality:

- **Uptime / performance**: better performance can mean more consistent rewards and lower slashing risk.
- **Slashing history**: penalties can reduce principal or rewards.
- **Operational security**: key management, monitoring, and incident response.
- **Governance participation**: validators vote on proposals; their votes may matter to you.

## On Sei Network

Sei is a high-performance Layer 1 with **EVM compatibility** and fast finality (around **~400ms** under normal conditions). Validators on Sei secure the network and finalize blocks quickly, and delegators can stake SEI to them to earn rewards.

Validator commission on Sei works the same way as in other Cosmos-SDK staking systems:

- Rewards generated by staking are allocated to the validator’s pool.
- The validator’s commission is taken from rewards before delegators receive their share.
- Commission changes are restricted by the validator’s declared max rate and max change rate.

Because Sei emphasizes throughput and low latency, validator operations (reliable infrastructure, monitoring, and timely maintenance) are particularly important. Commission is one indicator of how a validator funds those operations, but it should be balanced with performance and risk management.

## Checking Validator Commission (CLI)

You can view a validator’s commission settings using the Sei binary (command name may vary by installation/network):

```bash
seid query staking validator <validator-operator-address>
```

Look for fields similar to:

- `commission.commission_rates.rate`
- `commission.commission_rates.max_rate`
- `commission.commission_rates.max_change_rate`

You can also list validators and inspect their commission rates:

```bash
seid query staking validators
```

## Commission vs. Other Costs

Commission is distinct from transaction gas fees:

- **Commission** affects staking rewards distribution between validator and delegators.
- **Gas fees** are paid to execute transactions (including claiming rewards, redelegating, or undelegating). On Sei, EVM users pay gas similarly to other EVM chains.

## Practical Tips for Delegators

- Compare **net returns** (after commission) across several reputable validators.
- Prefer validators with transparent policies, consistent uptime, and strong operational practices—even if commission is slightly higher.
- Watch for validators with unusually low commission if it coincides with poor performance or unclear sustainability.
- Re-check commission periodically; while changes are limited, they can still evolve over time.

## Summary

Validator commission is the percentage of staking rewards a validator retains as payment for operating and securing the network. Delegators receive the remaining rewards after commission is applied, and commission changes are bounded by predefined limits. On Sei, commission follows standard Cosmos-style staking mechanics, supporting a validator set that can deliver Sei’s fast finality and high-performance execution environment.
