## Overview

Total Value Locked (TVL) is the total value of assets deposited into a DeFi protocol (or across an ecosystem), typically measured in USD. It’s commonly used as a quick proxy for how much capital is actively being used in smart contracts for activities like lending, trading, staking, and liquidity provision. TVL matters because it helps assess adoption, liquidity depth, and (to a limited extent) perceived trust in a protocol.

## How It Works

TVL is usually calculated by summing the value of on-chain assets held by a protocol’s smart contracts:

- **Liquidity pools (DEXs/AMMs):** value of both sides of each pool (e.g., ETH + USDC).
- **Lending markets:** supplied collateral and supplied assets (method varies by platform and analytics provider).
- **Staking / vaults:** assets deposited in staking contracts or strategy vaults.
- **Bridges / wrappers:** assets locked in bridge contracts (often tracked separately from DeFi TVL).

### Common calculation approach

1. **Identify relevant contracts** (pool contracts, vaults, lending markets, staking contracts).
2. **Fetch balances** of each token held by those contracts.
3. **Convert balances to USD** using a pricing source (DEX TWAPs, oracle feeds, or centralized price indexes).
4. **Aggregate** across contracts and token types.

A simplified formula:

- **TVL (USD)** = Σ (token_balance × token_price_USD)

### Why TVL matters

- **Liquidity and slippage:** Higher TVL in pools generally means deeper liquidity and better execution for traders.
- **User adoption signal:** Increasing TVL can indicate more users depositing capital or more strategies allocating funds.
- **Ecosystem health:** TVL can show whether capital is concentrating in a few protocols or spreading across many.
- **Risk context:** TVL can help compare protocol size and potential “blast radius” if something fails.

### Important limitations

TVL is useful, but it is not a complete measure of value or safety:

- **Price sensitivity:** TVL rises and falls with token prices even if deposits don’t change.
- **Double counting:** The same collateral may be reused (e.g., deposit → borrow → LP → vault), inflating aggregate TVL.
- **Incentive-driven TVL:** Short-term rewards can attract “mercenary” liquidity that exits when incentives end.
- **Doesn’t equal revenue:** High TVL doesn’t guarantee protocol fees, profitability, or sustainable usage.

## On Sei Network

On Sei, TVL represents the value of assets locked into Sei-native DeFi applications (and, where applicable, EVM-based contracts deployed on Sei’s EVM). It’s often used to gauge how much capital is actively participating in Sei’s on-chain economy across:

- **DEX liquidity pools** supporting fast swaps and liquid markets
- **Lending/borrowing protocols** where collateral and borrowed assets are managed on-chain
- **Staking and vault strategies** that deploy assets into automated positions
- **Cross-chain assets** bridged onto Sei and deposited into applications

### Why TVL is especially relevant on Sei

- **High-performance trading environment:** Sei is designed for high-throughput DeFi; deeper liquidity (higher TVL) can translate into tighter spreads and lower slippage for traders.
- **Fast finality (~400ms):** Faster finality improves UX for trading and liquidations; TVL in lending/DEX protocols can become more “usable” with less latency between action and confirmation.
- **Parallelization:** Sei’s parallel execution can support many simultaneous users and transactions. As TVL and activity scale, parallelization helps maintain performance under load.
- **EVM compatibility:** Teams can deploy Solidity smart contracts and port EVM DeFi patterns to Sei. TVL is commonly tracked across both Sei-native and EVM applications (depending on analytics coverage).

### Practical interpretation tips for Sei users

When evaluating TVL on Sei, consider pairing it with other metrics:

- **Volume and active users:** Helps distinguish “locked but idle” liquidity from actively used liquidity.
- **Fees/revenue:** Indicates whether the protocol converts TVL into sustainable economics.
- **Concentration:** If most TVL sits in one pool or protocol, systemic risk is higher.
- **Asset mix:** TVL dominated by volatile tokens will fluctuate more than TVL dominated by stablecoins.

## Example: Reading TVL from on-chain balances (EVM-style)

Below is a simplified example of how an analytics script might compute TVL for a single pool contract by summing token balances and applying prices.

```typescript
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

const ERC20_ABI = ['function balanceOf(address) view returns (uint256)', 'function decimals() view returns (uint8)'];

async function getTokenUSDValue(provider: ethers.Provider, token: string, holder: string, priceUsd: number) {
  const erc20 = new ethers.Contract(token, ERC20_ABI, provider);
  const [bal, decimals] = await Promise.all([erc20.balanceOf(holder), erc20.decimals()]);

  const amount = Number(ethers.formatUnits(bal, decimals));
  return amount * priceUsd;
}

async function main() {
  const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(process.env.SEI_EVM_RPC_URL);

  const pool = '0xPoolContractAddress...';
  const tokenA = '0xTokenA...';
  const tokenB = '0xTokenB...';

  // Prices are placeholders (in practice, sourced from an oracle/index)
  const priceA = 1.0;
  const priceB = 2500.0;

  const tvlA = await getTokenUSDValue(provider, tokenA, pool, priceA);
  const tvlB = await getTokenUSDValue(provider, tokenB, pool, priceB);

  const tvl = tvlA + tvlB;
  console.log(`Pool TVL (USD): $${tvl.toFixed(2)}`);
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

## Key Takeaways

- TVL measures how much value is deposited into DeFi smart contracts and is widely used to compare protocol and ecosystem scale.
- It matters because it correlates with liquidity depth, adoption, and usability—but it can be inflated or distorted by prices, leverage, and incentives.
- On Sei, TVL is a helpful lens for understanding capital formation in a fast-finality, parallelized, EVM-compatible DeFi environment—best interpreted alongside volume, users, and fee metrics.
