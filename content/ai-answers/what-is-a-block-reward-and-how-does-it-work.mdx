## Overview

A **block reward** is the compensation paid to a blockchain validator (or miner) for producing a valid block. It typically includes **newly issued tokens** (inflation) and may also include **transaction fees** collected from transactions in that block.

Block rewards incentivize honest participation, fund network security, and help distribute the network’s native token over time according to protocol rules.

## How It Works

### 1) Why block rewards exist

Most blockchains need participants to spend resources (capital, hardware, stake, operations) to keep the network running. Block rewards align incentives by paying the entity that proposes and finalizes blocks, encouraging:

- **Availability** (validators stay online)
- **Correctness** (validators follow consensus rules)
- **Security** (attacking the chain becomes expensive)

### 2) What makes up a block reward

A validator’s total payout per block can be composed of:

- **Block subsidy (issuance):** New tokens minted by the protocol on a schedule (fixed, halving, or dynamic).
- **Transaction fees:** Gas fees or other per-transaction charges included in the block.
- **Additional incentives (optional):** Some networks add MEV policies, proposer tips, or special rewards.

### 3) How rewards are calculated and distributed

While details vary by chain, distribution commonly follows these steps:

1. **Block proposal:** A validator is selected (deterministically or pseudo-randomly) to propose the next block.
2. **Validation and finalization:** Other validators verify and vote on the block according to the consensus protocol.
3. **Reward accounting:** The protocol computes rewards based on parameters like inflation rate, total stake, block time, and included fees.
4. **Payout:** Rewards are credited to the proposer and/or shared with participating validators and delegators, sometimes after a delay or subject to slashing conditions.

### 4) Block rewards vs. transaction fees

- **Block rewards (issuance)** are protocol-controlled and may decrease over time or adjust dynamically.
- **Transaction fees** are demand-driven, rising and falling with network usage.

Some networks aim to reduce issuance and rely more on fees over time, while others maintain ongoing inflation to fund security.

## On Sei Network

Sei is a high-performance Layer 1 with **EVM compatibility**, designed for fast execution and rapid settlement. Block rewards on Sei follow the same core purpose—**incentivizing validators** to propose and finalize blocks—while operating in an environment optimized for throughput and responsiveness.

Key considerations on Sei:

- **Fast finality (~400ms):** With quick finality, rewards and fee flows are tied to a rapid block production cadence, supporting responsive onchain applications.
- **Parallelization:** Sei’s parallelized execution model helps process many transactions efficiently. As throughput increases, **fee revenue** (the fee component of the reward) can become more meaningful depending on network usage.
- **EVM compatibility:** For EVM-based transactions, fees are paid in the standard EVM “gas” model. Those transaction fees contribute to the economic incentives for validators and the network’s security budget, alongside any protocol-defined issuance.
- **Validator + delegator economics:** As a staking-based network, Sei rewards are generally earned by validators and then shared with delegators according to validator commission and staking rules (with slashing risk for misbehavior where applicable).

> Exact reward formulas (issuance schedules, distribution splits, and parameters) are chain-governed and can evolve via onchain governance.

## Example: Observing Block Rewards and Fees (EVM)

You can inspect recent blocks and their gas usage/fees using common Ethereum tooling against a Sei EVM RPC endpoint.

```bash
# Get the latest block (replace with your Sei EVM RPC endpoint)
curl -s https://<sei-evm-rpc> \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id":1,
    "method":"eth_getBlockByNumber",
    "params":["latest", false]
  }' | jq
```

To see fee-related fields (when supported by the node/client), query a block and inspect properties such as gas used and base fee:

```bash
curl -s https://<sei-evm-rpc> \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id":1,
    "method":"eth_getBlockByNumber",
    "params":["0x1", true]
  }' | jq '.result | {number, gasUsed, baseFeePerGas, transactions}'
```

## Key Takeaways

- A **block reward** is the payout for producing a valid block, usually combining **new token issuance** and **transaction fees**.
- Rewards are a core security mechanism, incentivizing validators to follow consensus rules.
- On **Sei Network**, block rewards operate within a system optimized for **parallel execution**, **~400ms finality**, and **EVM-compatible** transaction fees.
