## Overview

Oracles are middleware services that deliver external (off-chain) data and computation results to smart contracts on a blockchain. Because blockchains can’t natively fetch web APIs, market prices, or real-world events, oracles bridge that gap by supplying verifiable inputs that contracts can use to execute logic deterministically.

## How It Works

### Why smart contracts need oracles

Smart contracts run inside a blockchain’s execution environment, which is intentionally isolated to ensure every node can reproduce the same result. If a contract could freely call an external API, different nodes might see different responses (due to latency, outages, or manipulation), breaking consensus. Oracles provide a controlled way to import external truth.

### Common oracle models

- **Push-based (publisher) oracles:** The oracle periodically publishes data (e.g., asset prices) on-chain. Contracts read the latest value when needed.
- **Pull-based (request/response) oracles:** A contract requests data, and an oracle network fulfills the request with a response transaction.
- **Cross-chain oracles / bridges:** Provide verified information about events or state on other chains.
- **Compute oracles:** Perform off-chain computation (e.g., randomness, proofs, complex analytics) and report results on-chain.

### Trust and verification patterns

Oracles must address the “oracle problem”: ensuring the data is accurate and resistant to manipulation.

Common techniques include:

- **Decentralized oracle networks (DONs):** Multiple independent nodes fetch the same data; results are aggregated to reduce reliance on a single party.
- **Cryptographic proofs:** Signed reports, threshold signatures, or zero-knowledge proofs to attest to correctness.
- **Data aggregation:** Median/mean with outlier filtering, quorum thresholds, and update rules (heartbeats, deviation thresholds).
- **Economic security:** Staking, slashing, reputation systems, or payment incentives to encourage honest reporting.

### Typical data flow

1. **Source selection:** Choose reputable data sources (exchanges, APIs, sensors, etc.).
2. **Data retrieval:** Oracle nodes fetch data off-chain.
3. **Aggregation & signing:** Nodes aggregate and sign a final value.
4. **On-chain delivery:** A transaction updates an on-chain oracle contract with the new data.
5. **Consumption:** Smart contracts read the value and execute logic (settlements, liquidations, payouts).

## On Sei Network

Sei Network’s high-performance Layer 1 design makes oracle updates and oracle-consuming transactions especially practical for real-time DeFi and trading applications.

- **Fast finality (~400ms):** Oracle updates (price feeds, funding rates, volatility measures) can reach finality quickly, reducing the window where protocols rely on stale data.
- **Parallelization:** Sei can process many transactions concurrently, which helps when multiple feeds update frequently and many contracts read oracle values in the same block.
- **EVM compatibility:** Solidity smart contracts on Sei can integrate with oracle contracts using familiar patterns (interfaces, address-based feeds), making it straightforward to port oracle-enabled dApps from other EVM chains.

### Example: reading a price from an oracle feed (Solidity)

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

interface IPriceOracle {
    function latestAnswer() external view returns (int256);
    function latestTimestamp() external view returns (uint256);
}

contract OracleConsumer {
    IPriceOracle public immutable feed;

    constructor(address feedAddress) {
        feed = IPriceOracle(feedAddress);
    }

    function getLatestPrice() external view returns (int256 price, uint256 updatedAt) {
        price = feed.latestAnswer();
        updatedAt = feed.latestTimestamp();
    }

    // Example safety check: reject stale oracle data
    function getFreshPrice(uint256 maxAgeSeconds) external view returns (int256) {
        int256 price = feed.latestAnswer();
        uint256 updatedAt = feed.latestTimestamp();
        require(block.timestamp - updatedAt <= maxAgeSeconds, "STALE_ORACLE_DATA");
        return price;
    }
}
```

### Example: calling a Sei EVM contract that uses an oracle (TypeScript)

```typescript
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

const RPC_URL = process.env.SEI_EVM_RPC!;
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(RPC_URL);

const consumerAbi = ['function getLatestPrice() view returns (int256 price, uint256 updatedAt)'];

const consumerAddress = '0xYourConsumerContractAddress';
const consumer = new ethers.Contract(consumerAddress, consumerAbi, provider);

async function main() {
  const [price, updatedAt] = await consumer.getLatestPrice();
  console.log('price:', price.toString());
  console.log('updatedAt:', updatedAt.toString());
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

## Practical Considerations

- **Staleness controls:** Always track timestamps and enforce max-age rules, especially for liquidation and settlement logic.
- **Update frequency vs. cost:** Higher frequency improves accuracy but increases on-chain writes; Sei’s performance helps, but design feeds thoughtfully (heartbeats/deviation thresholds).
- **Source diversity:** Prefer oracle solutions that aggregate multiple data sources and operators.
- **Fallback behavior:** Define what your contract should do if the oracle is unavailable or returns invalid data (pause, revert, use last-known-good value with tighter limits).
- **Decimals and units:** Normalize values (e.g., 8 decimals for prices) and document assumptions to prevent integration errors.

## Common Use Cases

- **DeFi:** Lending/borrowing collateral pricing, liquidations, perpetuals funding rates, AMM safeguards.
- **Derivatives & settlements:** Event outcomes, index prices, TWAP/VWAP feeds.
- **Insurance & gaming:** Weather/event triggers, randomness (with verifiable schemes).
- **Cross-chain apps:** Validating events or states from other networks.
