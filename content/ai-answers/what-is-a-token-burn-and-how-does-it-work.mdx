# What is a Token Burn and How Does It Work?

## Overview

A **token burn** is the intentional, verifiable destruction of cryptocurrency tokens by sending them to an address that cannot spend them (often called a _burn address_ or _black hole address_). The goal is to reduce the circulating supply, which can affect a token’s economics (tokenomics) by increasing scarcity or aligning incentives.

In other words, if you’re asking **what is token burn**, it’s a supply-reduction mechanism executed on-chain so anyone can audit the burn transaction.

## How It Works

### Common burn mechanisms

Token burns are typically implemented in one of these ways:

1. **Send to an irrecoverable address**

   - Tokens are transferred to an address with no known private key (e.g., `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD` on EVM chains).
   - The tokens still “exist” in the ledger but are effectively removed from circulation forever.

2. **Burn via smart contract function**

   - Many token standards or custom contracts implement a `burn()` function that reduces the caller’s balance and decreases total supply (or moves tokens to a burn address).
   - This is often cleaner for accounting because `totalSupply` can be updated directly.

3. **Protocol-level burns**
   - Some networks burn a portion of transaction fees (or other protocol revenues).
   - This creates a continuous burn that scales with network usage.

### Why projects burn tokens

Projects may burn tokens to:

- **Reduce circulating supply** and potentially increase scarcity
- **Offset emissions** (e.g., from staking rewards)
- **Stabilize tokenomics** or support a long-term policy
- **Signal commitment** (e.g., burning team allocation, unsold tokens)
- **Tie burns to revenue** (e.g., buyback-and-burn or fee burns)

### What a burn does—and doesn’t—guarantee

- A burn **does** reduce circulating supply (and sometimes total supply, depending on implementation).
- A burn **does not** guarantee price increases; price depends on demand, liquidity, market conditions, unlock schedules, and broader token utility.

### How to verify a token burn

You can verify burns by checking:

- The **transaction hash** sending tokens to the burn address
- The **token contract’s `Transfer` events**
- The **burn address balance** (it should only increase)
- Whether **`totalSupply` decreases** (if the contract updates it)

## On Sei Network

On **Sei Network** (an EVM-compatible Layer 1), token burns for ERC-20–style tokens work the same way they do on other EVM chains: projects can burn tokens by transferring them to an irrecoverable address or by calling a `burn()` function in a smart contract.

Sei’s advantages—**high throughput via parallelization** and **~400ms finality**—make burn-related operations (like periodic burns, buyback-and-burn execution, or fee-driven burns) settle quickly and predictably. This can be useful for applications that rely on time-sensitive supply adjustments or transparent, frequent burn events.

## Example: Burning tokens by sending to a burn address (Solidity)

A minimal ERC-20 token burn can be implemented by transferring tokens to a known burn address:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

interface IERC20 {
    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
}

contract BurnHelper {
    // Common EVM burn address
    address public constant BURN_ADDRESS = 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD;

    function burn(IERC20 token, uint256 amount) external {
        // Caller must have approved this contract to spend `amount`
        require(token.transfer(BURN_ADDRESS, amount), "Transfer failed");
    }
}
```

**Notes**

- This approach does **not** necessarily reduce `totalSupply` unless the token contract treats transfers to the burn address specially. It does, however, remove tokens from practical circulation.

## Example: Burning tokens by reducing total supply (Solidity)

Many projects implement a `burn()` function that reduces both the holder’s balance and `totalSupply`:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract BurnableToken is ERC20 {
    constructor() ERC20("Burnable Token", "BURN") {
        _mint(msg.sender, 1_000_000 ether);
    }

    function burn(uint256 amount) external {
        _burn(msg.sender, amount); // reduces sender balance and totalSupply
    }
}
```

## Example: Calling burn on Sei EVM (TypeScript)

Using `ethers` to call a `burn(uint256)` function from a dApp:

```typescript
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

const RPC_URL = process.env.SEI_EVM_RPC!;
const PRIVATE_KEY = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY!;
const TOKEN_ADDRESS = '0xYourTokenAddress';

const ABI = ['function burn(uint256 amount) external', 'function decimals() view returns (uint8)'];

async function main() {
  const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(RPC_URL);
  const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(PRIVATE_KEY, provider);

  const token = new ethers.Contract(TOKEN_ADDRESS, ABI, wallet);

  const decimals: number = await token.decimals();
  const amount = ethers.parseUnits('100', decimals); // burn 100 tokens

  const tx = await token.burn(amount);
  console.log('Submitted:', tx.hash);

  const receipt = await tx.wait();
  console.log('Confirmed in block:', receipt.blockNumber);
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

## Key Takeaways

- **What is token burn?** It’s the deliberate destruction (or permanent removal from circulation) of tokens, executed transparently on-chain.
- Burns are commonly done by **sending tokens to an irrecoverable address** or calling a **contract burn function** that reduces `totalSupply`.
- On **Sei Network**, token burns work like any EVM chain, with the benefit of **parallelized execution** and **~400ms finality** for fast, auditable burn settlement.
