## Overview

Staking is a mechanism where token holders lock up (or delegate) their tokens to help secure a blockchain network and participate in block production and governance, typically earning rewards in return. It’s most commonly associated with Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and related consensus models, where economic incentives and penalties encourage honest behavior.

## How It Works

### Proof-of-Stake basics

In PoS-style networks, validators are selected to propose and attest to new blocks based on their stake (the amount of tokens they have bonded/locked) and other protocol rules. Instead of spending energy to mine blocks (as in Proof-of-Work), validators commit capital—if they behave maliciously or fail to meet obligations, they can lose some of their stake through **slashing**.

### Key roles

- **Validators**: Run infrastructure, participate in consensus, and earn rewards/fees for correctly proposing and validating blocks.
- **Delegators/Stakers**: Token holders who delegate stake to validators without running validator infrastructure themselves. Delegators share in rewards (minus validator commission) and share in some risks.

### Typical staking lifecycle

1. **Choose a validator**: Evaluate uptime, commission rate, reputation, and governance participation.
2. **Bond/Delegate tokens**: Tokens are locked or bonded to a validator (often via on-chain transactions).
3. **Earn rewards**: Rewards are distributed periodically (e.g., per block or per epoch), usually proportional to stake.
4. **Participate in governance**: Many networks grant voting power based on staked tokens; delegators may inherit validator votes or override them depending on the chain’s governance model.
5. **Unbond/Undelegate**: To withdraw, tokens typically enter an unbonding period during which they are illiquid and still exposed to some protocol rules.

### Rewards and risks

**Rewards may include:**

- Inflationary emissions (newly minted tokens)
- A share of transaction fees and MEV (depending on the chain)

**Risks may include:**

- **Slashing** for downtime, double-signing, or other protocol violations
- **Smart contract risk** if staking via liquid staking derivatives or third-party protocols
- **Illiquidity** during bonding/unbonding periods
- **Validator risk** (poor operations or malicious behavior can impact delegators)

## On Sei Network

Sei Network is a high-performance Layer 1 with **EVM compatibility** and fast consensus, designed to support parallelized execution while maintaining strong security guarantees. Staking on Sei secures the base layer, aligns incentives for validators and delegators, and supports governance—benefiting from Sei’s architecture, including **parallelization** and **~400ms finality** for responsive on-chain activity.

### What staking secures on Sei

- **Consensus and finality**: Validators participate in block production and voting, enabling rapid transaction finality.
- **Network reliability**: Economic incentives encourage validators to maintain uptime and correct behavior.
- **Governance**: Staked tokens typically translate into voting power for network parameter changes and upgrades.

### Delegation model

Most users stake by **delegating** tokens to a validator rather than running a validator node. Delegation:

- Assigns your stake weight to a validator
- Shares validator rewards (after commission)
- Exposes you to validator-related penalties where applicable

### EVM compatibility considerations

Sei’s EVM compatibility enables Solidity-based applications and tooling. While staking itself is a protocol-level function, EVM compatibility makes it easier for wallets, dashboards, and dApps to integrate staking-related flows and analytics alongside smart contract interactions.

## Example: Staking/Delegation via CLI

Below is an example of delegating tokens to a validator using a Cosmos-SDK-style CLI (exact binary name and flags may vary by environment and release):

```bash
# Delegate 10 SEI (denominated in usei or sei depending on chain config)
seid tx staking delegate <validator-operator-address> 10000000usei \
  --from <your-key-name> \
  --chain-id <sei-chain-id> \
  --gas auto --gas-adjustment 1.3 \
  --fees 2000usei
```

Check your delegation:

```bash
seid query staking delegation <your-account-address> <validator-operator-address>
```

Claim staking rewards:

```bash
seid tx distribution withdraw-rewards <validator-operator-address> \
  --from <your-key-name> \
  --commission \
  --chain-id <sei-chain-id> \
  --fees 2000usei
```

## Practical Tips for Stakers

- Prefer validators with strong uptime, transparent operations, and reasonable commission.
- Diversify across multiple validators if supported by your strategy and tooling.
- Understand slashing conditions and unbonding timelines before staking significant amounts.
- If using liquid staking or third-party staking services, evaluate smart contract and counterparty risks carefully.

## Summary

Staking is the process of committing tokens to help secure a PoS blockchain and earn rewards, either by running a validator or delegating to one. It works by aligning economic incentives—rewards for correct participation and potential penalties for misbehavior. On Sei Network, staking underpins fast, secure consensus and governance, complementing Sei’s parallelized design and ~400ms finality while remaining accessible through modern tooling and EVM-compatible ecosystems.
