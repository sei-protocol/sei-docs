## Overview

Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) is the additional profit that can be captured by controlling or influencing transaction ordering, inclusion, or exclusion within a block. It matters because it can raise execution costs for users, create unfair outcomes (like being sandwiched), and introduce security and centralization risks if not mitigated.

## How It Works

In most blockchains, many transactions compete for limited block space. Because transaction outcomes can depend on ordering (especially in DeFi), the party that decides ordering—typically the block producer (validator/miner) or a specialized “searcher” working with them—can extract value by reordering transactions to their advantage.

Common MEV patterns:

- **Arbitrage**: Reordering or inserting trades to capture price differences across pools/venues.
- **Sandwich attacks**: Placing a buy before and a sell after a user’s swap to profit from slippage.
- **Liquidations**: Competing to liquidate undercollateralized positions, often via priority ordering.
- **Backrunning**: Placing a transaction immediately after another to profit from its state changes (e.g., after a large swap moves price).
- **Time-bandit attacks (reorg MEV)**: Attempting to reorganize recent blocks if the MEV opportunity is larger than the cost of reorging.

Why MEV matters:

- **User harm and worse execution**: Higher slippage, worse fills, and increased failed transactions.
- **Higher fees and congestion**: Searchers bid up fees to win ordering, affecting all users.
- **Centralization pressure**: If MEV is large, sophisticated actors can dominate block production or preferentially integrate with validators.
- **Protocol risk**: Incentives to reorg, censor, or manipulate ordering can undermine chain stability.

## On Sei Network

Sei is a high-performance Layer 1 designed for trading-focused workloads and includes **EVM compatibility**, enabling Solidity smart contracts and Ethereum tooling. MEV dynamics still exist on Sei anywhere transaction ordering impacts outcomes—especially around swaps, liquidations, and arbitrage in EVM DeFi.

Key considerations on Sei:

- **Fast finality (~400ms)**: Rapid block finality reduces the time window for certain adversarial behaviors and improves user experience, but it doesn’t eliminate MEV; ordering-based opportunities can still exist within and across blocks.
- **Parallelization**: Sei’s parallel execution model increases throughput and reduces congestion, which can lower some fee-driven competition. However, parallelism also makes it important for applications to design carefully around state contention and ordering-sensitive paths.
- **EVM execution environment**: MEV bots and searchers built for Ethereum can often be adapted to Sei’s EVM, so application-level protections (slippage controls, TWAP/oracle usage, anti-sandwich measures, private execution paths) remain relevant.

Practical impacts for Sei builders and users:

- **DEX users** should set appropriate slippage, consider limit orders (if supported), and prefer routing mechanisms that minimize sandwich risk.
- **Protocol developers** should design to reduce ordering sensitivity (e.g., batch auctions, commit-reveal for intent-based trading, robust oracle integration, liquidation mechanisms that reduce winner-take-all races).

## Examples

### Solidity: basic slippage protection on swaps

Slippage bounds don’t prevent all MEV, but they limit how much a sandwich or adverse ordering can worsen execution.

```solidity
// Example interface for a UniswapV2-like router
interface IRouter {
    function swapExactTokensForTokens(
        uint amountIn,
        uint amountOutMin,
        address[] calldata path,
        address to,
        uint deadline
    ) external returns (uint[] memory amounts);
}

contract SlippageBoundSwap {
    IRouter public immutable router;

    constructor(address _router) {
        router = IRouter(_router);
    }

    function swap(
        uint amountIn,
        uint amountOutMin,
        address[] calldata path
    ) external {
        // amountOutMin is the key anti-MEV parameter:
        // it reverts if execution price moves too far against the user.
        router.swapExactTokensForTokens(
            amountIn,
            amountOutMin,
            path,
            msg.sender,
            block.timestamp + 60
        );
    }
}
```

### TypeScript: simulate expected output and set `amountOutMin`

Off-chain quoting plus a conservative tolerance is a common baseline defense.

```typescript
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

const SLIPPAGE_BPS = 50n; // 0.50%
const BPS = 10_000n;

function withSlippage(amountOut: bigint, slippageBps: bigint) {
  return (amountOut * (BPS - slippageBps)) / BPS;
}

// amountOutQuoted obtained from a quoter/DEX SDK call
const amountOutQuoted: bigint = 1_000_000n;

const amountOutMin = withSlippage(amountOutQuoted, SLIPPAGE_BPS);
console.log({ amountOutMin });
```

## Key Takeaways

- MEV is value extracted from transaction ordering, inclusion, or censorship.
- It affects users (worse prices), networks (fee spikes), and security (reorg/censorship incentives).
- On Sei, **fast finality (~400ms)**, **parallelization**, and **EVM compatibility** shape MEV behavior, but MEV remains relevant—especially in DeFi—so applications should adopt protective design patterns.
