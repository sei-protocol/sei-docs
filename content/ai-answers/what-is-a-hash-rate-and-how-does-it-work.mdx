## Overview

Hash rate is the speed at which a computer, miner, or network can compute cryptographic hashes—typically measured in hashes per second (H/s). In Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains, hash rate is a core security and performance metric because it reflects how much computational power is competing to produce new blocks.

## How It Works

### Hashing in blockchains

A **hash function** takes an input (like block data) and deterministically produces a fixed-length output (the “hash”). Good cryptographic hash functions have properties that make them useful for consensus and integrity:

- **Deterministic:** same input → same output
- **Fast to compute:** easy to hash data
- **Hard to reverse:** infeasible to derive input from output
- **Collision-resistant:** extremely hard to find different inputs with the same output

### Hash rate in Proof-of-Work mining

In PoW systems (e.g., Bitcoin), miners repeatedly vary a value (commonly called a **nonce**) and hash the block header until they find a hash that meets a network-defined condition (usually “hash must be less than a target,” often expressed as a number of leading zeros).

- Each attempt is one hash computation.
- The **hash rate** is the number of attempts per second.
- A higher hash rate means miners collectively test more nonces per second, increasing the chance of finding a valid block sooner.

### Difficulty and security

Most PoW chains adjust **difficulty** to keep block times stable. When total network hash rate rises, the chain increases difficulty so blocks don’t get produced too quickly; when hash rate drops, difficulty decreases.

Hash rate is also a proxy for **security** in PoW:

- Higher hash rate generally makes it more expensive to attack the network (e.g., attempting a 51% attack).
- Lower hash rate can reduce the cost of reorganizations or censorship attacks.

### Units and scale

Hash rate is commonly reported with SI prefixes:

- kH/s (thousand)
- MH/s (million)
- GH/s (billion)
- TH/s (trillion)
- PH/s (quadrillion)
- EH/s (quintillion)

Because modern networks perform massive numbers of hashes, you’ll often see TH/s or higher.

## On Sei Network

Sei Network is **not** a Proof-of-Work blockchain, so **hash rate is not a network security metric on Sei**. Sei is a high-performance Layer 1 designed for fast execution and trading-oriented workloads, using a consensus approach that provides **~400ms finality** and leverages **parallelization** to increase throughput.

Where hashing _does_ matter on Sei is in the normal ways it matters on most blockchains:

- **Transaction and block integrity:** transactions and blocks reference hashes to ensure tamper-evidence.
- **State commitments:** hash-based structures (e.g., Merkle trees or similar commitment schemes) help nodes verify state and data efficiently.
- **EVM compatibility:** Solidity contracts on Sei still rely on cryptographic hashes (e.g., `keccak256`) for common patterns like mappings, signatures, and commit-reveal schemes.

In other words, Sei uses hashing extensively, but it does not rely on “hashing power” competition (hash rate) to produce blocks.

## Examples

### Solidity: hashing data with `keccak256` (EVM on Sei)

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

contract HashingExample {
    function hashOrder(
        address trader,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 nonce
    ) external pure returns (bytes32) {
        // Common pattern: hash structured data deterministically
        return keccak256(abi.encode(trader, amount, nonce));
    }
}
```

### Solidity: commit-reveal using hashes

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

contract CommitReveal {
    mapping(address => bytes32) public commitOf;

    function commit(bytes32 commitment) external {
        commitOf[msg.sender] = commitment;
    }

    function reveal(uint256 secret, bytes32 salt) external view returns (bool) {
        bytes32 expected = commitOf[msg.sender];
        bytes32 actual = keccak256(abi.encode(secret, salt));
        return actual == expected;
    }
}
```

### Reading PoW hash rate (general concept) via a block explorer API

Hash rate is typically obtained from PoW chain telemetry or explorers rather than computed directly by dApps. Example (illustrative) API call:

```bash
curl https://example-explorer.io/api/network/hashrate
```

## Key Takeaways

- Hash rate measures how many hash computations are performed per second.
- It is crucial in **Proof-of-Work** networks for block production, difficulty adjustment, and security.
- Sei Network does **not** use PoW, so hash rate is not a core metric for Sei consensus; Sei focuses on **fast finality (~400ms)**, **parallelized execution**, and **EVM compatibility**, while still using hashing for integrity and cryptographic primitives.
