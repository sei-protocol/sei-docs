# What is a Hash Rate and How Does It Work?

## Overview

Hash rate is a measure of how much computational work a blockchain network (or a single miner/validator) can perform per second to compute cryptographic hashes. In simple terms, it describes how quickly machines can attempt to solve the hashing “puzzle” required by Proof-of-Work (PoW) systems. If you’re searching **what is hash rate**, think of it as the network’s hashing “speed” and a key indicator of PoW security and competition.

## How It Works

### Hashing and “Attempts per Second”

A **hash** is the output of a cryptographic hash function (e.g., SHA-256) that deterministically maps any input into a fixed-length string. In PoW mining, participants repeatedly vary an input value (often called a _nonce_) and hash the block header until they find an output that meets the network’s difficulty target (e.g., the hash must be below a certain number).

- Each hash computation is effectively one “attempt.”
- **Hash rate** is the number of attempts per second.

Common units:

- **H/s**: hashes per second
- **kH/s, MH/s, GH/s, TH/s, PH/s, EH/s**: thousand → million → billion → trillion → quadrillion → quintillion → exahashes per second

### Network Hash Rate vs. Miner Hash Rate

- **Miner hash rate**: the hashing power contributed by one device, miner, or pool.
- **Network hash rate**: the combined hash rate of all miners participating in the PoW network.

### Difficulty and Block Production

PoW networks adjust **difficulty** so that blocks are produced at a stable average interval (e.g., ~10 minutes on Bitcoin). When total hash rate increases, blocks would be found faster _unless_ the network increases difficulty; when hash rate drops, difficulty may decrease so blocks don’t become too slow.

Conceptually:

- Higher hash rate (with constant difficulty) → blocks found faster
- Higher difficulty (with constant hash rate) → blocks found slower

### Why Hash Rate Matters

In PoW, hash rate is closely tied to:

- **Security**: More total hash rate generally makes it harder to attack the chain (e.g., a “51% attack” requires enormous compute).
- **Decentralization/Competition**: Hash rate distribution across miners/pools affects how concentrated mining power is.
- **Energy/Cost**: Mining resources scale with hash rate (hardware and electricity).

### Simple Mining Pseudocode (Conceptual)

```typescript
// Conceptual PoW mining loop (not production code)
while (true) {
  const nonce = randomNonce();
  const hash = sha256(blockHeader + nonce);

  if (hash < targetDifficulty) {
    // Found a valid block
    submitBlock(blockHeader, nonce);
    break;
  }
}
// Hash rate ≈ how many iterations (hash attempts) you can do per second
```

## On Sei Network

Sei Network is a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain with **~400ms finality**, **parallelization**, and **EVM compatibility**, but it is **not a Proof-of-Work chain**. That means the classic notion of “hash rate” (as used to measure PoW mining power) does **not** directly apply to Sei’s consensus security model.

### What’s the Equivalent Concept on Sei?

On Sei (as on other Proof-of-Stake-style systems), network security and block production depend on factors like:

- **Staked capital** securing consensus (rather than mining hash power)
- **Validator set** participation and performance
- **Consensus finality** (Sei targets ~400ms finality), which affects how quickly transactions become irreversible

So, if you’re evaluating Sei, you typically look at metrics such as:

- Total stake / bonded stake (economic security)
- Validator uptime, voting power distribution, and performance
- Throughput and latency enabled by Sei’s **parallel execution** and optimized architecture
- EVM compatibility for deploying Solidity smart contracts without PoW mining

### Takeaway

- **Hash rate** is a PoW-specific measure of computational power used to find valid blocks.
- **Sei Network** achieves security and fast finality without PoW mining, so **hash rate is not a core network metric**; instead, stake and validator consensus drive security, while Sei’s parallelization and fast finality drive performance.
