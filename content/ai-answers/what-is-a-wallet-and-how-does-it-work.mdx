## Overview

A **wallet** is a tool (app, browser extension, hardware device, or service) that manages the **cryptographic keys** used to control blockchain accounts and sign transactions. It does **not** “store coins” in the way a physical wallet stores cash; instead, it provides access to assets recorded on-chain and proves ownership by producing valid digital signatures.

## How It Works

### Public/Private Keys and Addresses

- A wallet controls a **private key** (secret) and derives a **public key** (shareable).
- A blockchain **address** is derived from the public key (exact derivation depends on the chain).
- Funds and NFTs live on the blockchain at addresses; the wallet lets you authorize actions from that address.

### Seed Phrases (Recovery Phrases)

Most modern wallets use a **seed phrase** (often 12 or 24 words) that deterministically generates many private keys (HD wallets).

- If you lose the seed phrase and the device breaks, you lose access.
- If someone gets your seed phrase, they can take your assets.

### Signing Transactions

To send tokens or interact with a smart contract:

1. The wallet constructs a transaction message (recipient/contract, amount, data, gas fees, nonce).
2. You approve it in the wallet UI.
3. The wallet **signs** it with your private key.
4. The signed transaction is broadcast to the network and, once included in a block and finalized, the state updates.

### Wallet Types

- **Software wallets** (mobile/desktop/browser): convenient; security depends on device hygiene.
- **Hardware wallets**: private key stays on a dedicated device; stronger protection against malware.
- **Custodial wallets** (exchanges): a third party holds keys; easier recovery but you trust the custodian.

### Gas Fees and Nonces

- Most chains require a fee (gas) to pay validators for computation and storage.
- A **nonce** (or sequence) prevents replay and orders transactions from an account.

## On Sei Network

Sei is a high-performance Layer 1 with **EVM compatibility** and fast finality (around **~400ms**), which affects how wallets and transactions feel in practice:

- **EVM compatibility:** Many Ethereum-style wallets and tooling can work with Sei’s EVM environment, allowing users to sign standard EVM transactions and interact with Solidity smart contracts.
- **Fast finality (~400ms):** Once a transaction is included, users typically see confirmation quickly, making wallet interactions (swaps, mints, game actions) feel more responsive.
- **Parallelization:** Sei’s execution optimizations enable higher throughput under load, so wallet-driven activity (e.g., DeFi bursts) can be processed efficiently while maintaining a smooth UX.

### Connecting a Wallet to Sei (EVM)

If you’re using an EVM wallet (for example, via `window.ethereum`), your dApp can request accounts and ensure the user is on Sei’s EVM network.

```typescript
// Minimal EVM wallet connection pattern (browser)
const provider = (window as any).ethereum;
if (!provider) throw new Error('No EVM wallet found');

await provider.request({ method: 'eth_requestAccounts' });

const chainId = await provider.request({ method: 'eth_chainId' });
console.log('Connected chainId:', chainId);
```

### Sending a Simple Transaction (EVM)

Below is a minimal example of sending native value (e.g., gas token) using ethers.

```typescript
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

const provider = new ethers.BrowserProvider((window as any).ethereum);
const signer = await provider.getSigner();

const tx = await signer.sendTransaction({
  to: '0xRecipientAddressHere',
  value: ethers.parseEther('0.01')
});

console.log('tx hash:', tx.hash);
await tx.wait();
console.log('confirmed');
```

### Interacting with a Smart Contract on Sei (EVM)

Wallets also sign contract calls (e.g., ERC-20 transfers, swaps, NFT mints):

```solidity
// Example ERC-20 interface snippet your dApp might call
interface IERC20 {
  function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
}
```

```typescript
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

const provider = new ethers.BrowserProvider((window as any).ethereum);
const signer = await provider.getSigner();

const token = new ethers.Contract('0xTokenAddress', ['function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) returns (bool)'], signer);

const tx = await token.transfer('0xRecipientAddressHere', 1_000_000n);
await tx.wait();
```

## Key Security Tips

- **Never share your seed phrase or private key.** No legitimate app or team will ask for it.
- Prefer a **hardware wallet** for large holdings.
- Verify **network, contract addresses, and transaction details** before signing.
- Beware of phishing sites and malicious approvals; regularly review and revoke unnecessary allowances.
