## Overview

A **cold wallet** is a cryptocurrency wallet that keeps private keys **offline**, reducing exposure to online attacks like malware, phishing, and remote exploits. It’s primarily used for **long-term storage** and high-value funds where security is prioritized over convenience.

Cold wallets typically take the form of **hardware wallets**, **air-gapped devices**, or **paper/seed backups**, and they are designed so signing transactions happens without placing the private key on an internet-connected machine.

## How It Works

In most blockchains, ownership of assets is controlled by a **private key** (or seed phrase that derives private keys). A wallet doesn’t “store coins”; it stores (or can regenerate) the keys that authorize spending on-chain.

Cold wallet operation generally follows this pattern:

1. **Key generation (offline)**  
   The wallet generates a seed phrase (e.g., 12/24 words) and derives private/public keys. The private key never leaves the cold environment.

2. **Receive funds (public information)**  
   The wallet can share a public address to receive tokens. This is safe to do online.

3. **Create an unsigned transaction (online)**  
   A connected device (phone/PC) constructs a transaction using public data (nonce, gas, recipient, amount). This transaction is not yet authorized.

4. **Sign the transaction (offline)**  
   The unsigned transaction is transferred to the cold wallet (USB, QR code, SD card depending on device). The cold wallet signs it internally, producing a signed transaction.

5. **Broadcast the signed transaction (online)**  
   The signed transaction is sent back to the online device and broadcast to the network. Only the signature is shared—**not** the private key.

### Hot Wallet vs Cold Wallet (quick comparison)

- **Hot wallet:** Keys on an internet-connected device; faster UX; higher risk surface.
- **Cold wallet:** Keys stay offline; best for custody and long-term storage; slower transaction flow.

## On Sei Network

Sei is a high-performance Layer 1 with **EVM compatibility**, enabling familiar Ethereum-style accounts, transactions, and tooling while benefiting from Sei’s performance characteristics such as **~400ms finality** and **parallelization**. Cold wallets on Sei work the same fundamental way: the private key remains offline, and the wallet signs transactions that are then broadcast to Sei.

Because Sei is EVM-compatible, cold-wallet usage typically resembles Ethereum workflows:

- Your cold wallet controls an **EVM address** (0x…).
- Transactions are **EIP-155 signed** by the cold wallet.
- You can use common EVM tooling (wallet apps, RPC providers, explorers) to build and broadcast signed transactions to Sei.

### Practical implications on Sei

- **Fast confirmation experience:** Once a signed transaction is broadcast to Sei, the network’s fast finality means the “send” flow can complete quickly.
- **Parallel execution:** Sei’s parallelization can improve throughput and responsiveness under load, but it does not change the cold wallet security model—security still depends on keeping keys offline and protecting the seed phrase.
- **EVM tooling compatibility:** Many existing signing/broadcast flows that work on Ethereum-style networks can be adapted to Sei by switching the RPC endpoint and chain ID.

## Example: Broadcasting a Signed Transaction to Sei (EVM)

Below is an example using `ethers` to send a signed transaction to Sei’s EVM endpoint. This is representative of a “cold” flow where signing could happen on a hardware wallet or offline signer; here we show an offline private key for demonstration purposes.

```typescript
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

async function main() {
  // Replace with a Sei EVM RPC endpoint (from your provider / environment)
  const rpcUrl = process.env.SEI_EVM_RPC!;
  const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(rpcUrl);

  // In a real cold-wallet setup, signing is done on the hardware device.
  // This is just an example of signing locally.
  const privateKey = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY!;
  const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(privateKey, provider);

  const to = '0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead';
  const value = ethers.parseEther('0.01');

  const tx = await wallet.sendTransaction({
    to,
    value
    // You can optionally specify gas settings; otherwise ethers will estimate.
    // gasLimit: 21000n,
  });

  console.log('Tx hash:', tx.hash);
  const receipt = await tx.wait();
  console.log('Confirmed in block:', receipt?.blockNumber);
}

main().catch((e) => {
  console.error(e);
  process.exit(1);
});
```

## Best Practices

- **Protect the seed phrase:** Store it offline in multiple secure locations; never type it into random websites or share it.
- **Use a reputable hardware wallet:** Prefer devices with secure elements and verified firmware.
- **Verify transaction details on-device:** Always confirm the recipient address and amount on the cold wallet screen (not only on the computer).
- **Keep software up to date:** Update wallet firmware and companion apps from official sources.
- **Consider multisig for treasury funds:** For organizations, multi-approval wallets reduce single-key risk.

## Common Cold Wallet Types

- **Hardware wallet:** Dedicated device that signs transactions internally.
- **Air-gapped computer:** Offline machine used for key management and signing.
- **Paper wallet / seed backup:** Offline record of keys/seed phrase (best used as backup, not as an active signing method).
