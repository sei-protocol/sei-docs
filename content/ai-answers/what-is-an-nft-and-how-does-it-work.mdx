# What is an NFT and How Does It Work?

## Overview

An NFT (non-fungible token) is a unique blockchain-based token that represents ownership or proof of authenticity for a specific item—such as digital art, game items, collectibles, tickets, or real-world assets. Unlike cryptocurrencies (which are interchangeable), each NFT is distinct and can carry unique metadata, making it suitable for tracking individual assets.

If you’re searching **what is NFT**, the simplest definition is: an NFT is a token that proves a particular wallet controls a specific, unique digital asset (or a claim to one).

## How It Works

### Non-fungible vs. fungible

- **Fungible tokens** (e.g., ETH, USDC) are interchangeable: 1 token equals any other token of the same type.
- **Non-fungible tokens** are not interchangeable: each token has a unique identifier and may have different attributes, history, and value.

### Core components of NFTs

1. **Smart contract**  
   NFTs are created and managed by smart contracts. The contract defines:

   - How new NFTs are minted
   - Ownership rules and transfers
   - Metadata references (often a URI)
   - Optional royalties or custom logic

2. **Token ID + Contract Address**
   On EVM chains, an NFT is commonly identified by:

   - The NFT contract address
   - A `tokenId` (unique within the contract)

3. **Ownership tracking**
   Ownership is recorded on-chain. When an NFT is transferred, the blockchain updates which address owns that `tokenId`.

4. **Metadata and media storage**
   Most NFTs don’t store large files directly on-chain. Instead, the NFT points to metadata (usually JSON), which points to the media (image/video/etc.):
   - **On-chain metadata**: stored directly in the contract (more permanent, more expensive)
   - **Off-chain metadata**: stored on centralized servers or decentralized storage (IPFS/Arweave)

A typical metadata JSON includes:

- `name`, `description`
- `image` URL (or IPFS URI)
- `attributes` (traits)

### Common NFT standards (EVM)

- **ERC-721**: one-of-one NFTs (each token ID is unique)
- **ERC-1155**: semi-fungible / batch-minting standard (useful for game items and editions)

### Minting and transferring (high-level flow)

1. **Mint**: a transaction calls the NFT contract to create a new token ID and assign it to a wallet address.
2. **List/Sell**: marketplaces use approvals to let a marketplace contract transfer NFTs on your behalf if sold.
3. **Transfer**: a transaction moves ownership from one address to another.
4. **Provenance**: transaction history provides an auditable trail of transfers and creation events.

## On Sei Network

Sei Network is a high-performance Layer 1 with **EVM compatibility**, meaning NFTs can be built and interacted with using familiar Ethereum tools and standards like **ERC-721** and **ERC-1155**. This lets developers and users mint, transfer, and trade NFTs with the same contract patterns and wallet workflows used across the EVM ecosystem.

Key implications for NFTs on Sei:

- **Fast user experience**: Sei’s ~**400ms finality** helps NFT mints, transfers, and marketplace actions confirm quickly, improving UX during drops and high-demand events.
- **Scalability via parallelization**: Sei’s parallelization helps process many transactions efficiently, which is especially helpful for large NFT mints, active marketplaces, and games where lots of NFT actions happen concurrently.
- **EVM tooling support**: You can use Solidity, popular libraries (e.g., OpenZeppelin), and common developer tooling to deploy NFT contracts on Sei’s EVM.

## Example: Minimal ERC-721 NFT Contract (Solidity)

Below is a simple ERC-721 contract using OpenZeppelin. This is a common starting point for NFTs on EVM-compatible networks like Sei.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

contract MyNFT is ERC721, Ownable {
    uint256 public nextTokenId;

    constructor() ERC721("MyNFT", "MNFT") Ownable(msg.sender) {}

    function mint(address to) external onlyOwner returns (uint256 tokenId) {
        tokenId = nextTokenId++;
        _safeMint(to, tokenId);
    }
}
```

### Adding metadata (tokenURI)

In many NFT projects, `tokenURI(tokenId)` returns a URL/IPFS URI for metadata. You can implement this by extending `ERC721URIStorage` or by building URIs yourself (for example, `ipfs://.../{tokenId}.json`).

## Example: Read NFT Owner with TypeScript (ethers)

This shows how a dApp can query NFT ownership from an ERC-721 contract.

```typescript
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

const rpcUrl = process.env.RPC_URL!;
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(rpcUrl);

const nftAddress = '0xYourNftContractAddress';
const abi = ['function ownerOf(uint256 tokenId) view returns (address)'];

async function main() {
  const nft = new ethers.Contract(nftAddress, abi, provider);
  const tokenId = 1;

  const owner = await nft.ownerOf(tokenId);
  console.log(`Owner of token ${tokenId}:`, owner);
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

## Practical Notes and Common Misconceptions

- **NFT ownership vs. file ownership**: owning an NFT usually means owning the token and its on-chain record, not necessarily copyright to the artwork unless explicitly granted.
- **Metadata permanence matters**: “decentralized” storage (IPFS/Arweave) can improve durability compared to a traditional web server.
- **Royalties aren’t guaranteed by default**: royalty enforcement often depends on marketplaces unless the NFT ecosystem uses enforceable mechanisms.

## Summary

An NFT is a unique token on a blockchain that proves ownership and enables transfer of a distinct asset via smart contracts. In general, NFTs work by combining on-chain ownership records with metadata that describes the asset. On **Sei Network**, NFTs benefit from **EVM compatibility**, **parallelization**, and ~**400ms finality**, enabling fast, scalable minting and trading experiences.
