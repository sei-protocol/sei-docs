## Overview

An NFT (Non-Fungible Token) is a unique digital token recorded on a blockchain that represents ownership or rights to a specific item—such as digital art, collectibles, game items, tickets, or membership access. Unlike cryptocurrencies (which are fungible and interchangeable), each NFT has distinct identity and metadata, making it non-interchangeable on a 1:1 basis.

## How It Works

### Fungible vs. Non-Fungible

- **Fungible tokens** (e.g., ETH, SEI, USDC) are interchangeable: 1 token equals any other token of the same type.
- **Non-fungible tokens** are unique: each token has a distinct identifier and often distinct metadata.

### Core Components of an NFT

- **Smart contract**: The on-chain program that defines the NFT collection and rules (minting, transfers, approvals).
- **Token ID**: A unique identifier within the collection contract (e.g., `#1`, `#2`, etc.).
- **Ownership**: The blockchain address that currently owns the token.
- **Metadata**: Data describing the NFT (name, description, traits, image). Often stored off-chain (e.g., IPFS/Arweave) with an on-chain URI pointer.
- **Provenance**: The blockchain provides an auditable history of transfers and (often) mint events.

### Typical NFT Lifecycle

1. **Deploy a contract** (or use an existing collection contract).
2. **Mint** an NFT: create a new token ID and assign an initial owner.
3. **Store/point to metadata**: the contract exposes a `tokenURI(tokenId)` that returns where metadata can be retrieved.
4. **Transfer or sell**: owners transfer NFTs directly or via marketplaces using approvals.
5. **Verify authenticity**: users and apps check the contract address + token ID (and sometimes creator signatures) to confirm authenticity.

### NFT Standards (EVM)

On EVM chains, NFTs commonly use:

- **ERC-721**: one-of-one tokens (each token ID is unique).
- **ERC-1155**: semi-fungible / multi-token standard (supports both unique and “edition” style tokens efficiently).

## On Sei Network

Sei is a high-performance Layer 1 with **EVM compatibility**, enabling NFT contracts and tooling similar to Ethereum while benefiting from Sei’s performance characteristics, including **parallelized execution** and **~400ms finality**. For NFT apps, this typically translates to:

- **Faster user experience**: mints, transfers, and marketplace interactions confirm quickly.
- **Higher throughput under load**: parallelization helps the network process many independent NFT actions efficiently (e.g., many users minting or trading across different collections).
- **EVM-native development**: you can deploy Solidity-based ERC-721/1155 contracts and integrate with standard wallets and libraries.

## Example: Minimal ERC-721 NFT (Solidity)

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

contract SimpleNFT is ERC721, Ownable {
    uint256 public nextTokenId;

    constructor() ERC721("SimpleNFT", "SNFT") Ownable(msg.sender) {}

    function mint(address to) external onlyOwner returns (uint256 tokenId) {
        tokenId = nextTokenId++;
        _safeMint(to, tokenId);
    }
}
```

### Adding Metadata via tokenURI (Common Pattern)

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721URIStorage.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

contract MetadataNFT is ERC721URIStorage, Ownable {
    uint256 public nextTokenId;

    constructor() ERC721("MetadataNFT", "MNFT") Ownable(msg.sender) {}

    function mint(address to, string calldata uri) external onlyOwner returns (uint256 tokenId) {
        tokenId = nextTokenId++;
        _safeMint(to, tokenId);
        _setTokenURI(tokenId, uri); // e.g., ipfs://<CID>/metadata.json
    }
}
```

## Example: Minting with ethers.js (TypeScript)

```typescript
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

const RPC_URL = process.env.RPC_URL!;
const PRIVATE_KEY = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY!;
const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = process.env.CONTRACT_ADDRESS!;

const abi = ['function mint(address to) external returns (uint256)'];

async function main() {
  const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(RPC_URL);
  const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(PRIVATE_KEY, provider);

  const nft = new ethers.Contract(CONTRACT_ADDRESS, abi, wallet);

  const to = '0xYourRecipientAddressHere';
  const tx = await nft.mint(to);
  console.log('tx hash:', tx.hash);

  const receipt = await tx.wait();
  console.log('confirmed in block:', receipt?.blockNumber);
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

## Key Concepts to Know

- **Ownership vs. content storage**: NFTs typically store ownership and metadata pointers on-chain, while large media files (images/videos) are stored off-chain.
- **Royalties**: Often implemented via marketplace conventions or optional standards; not universally enforced by default at the protocol level.
- **Authenticity**: A legitimate NFT is defined by the **contract address + token ID**; copies can exist elsewhere, so verifying the correct collection matters.
- **Security**: Use audited libraries (e.g., OpenZeppelin), restrict mint permissions, and test approvals/transfer logic carefully.

## Common Use Cases

- Digital art and collectibles
- Gaming assets (skins, items, characters)
- Membership passes and loyalty programs
- Tickets and event access
- On-chain identity, achievements, and credentials
