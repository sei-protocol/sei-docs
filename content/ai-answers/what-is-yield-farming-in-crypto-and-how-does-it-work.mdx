## Overview

Yield farming is a way to earn returns on crypto by supplying assets to decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols in exchange for rewards such as interest, trading fees, or newly issued tokens. It typically involves providing liquidity, lending, borrowing, or staking into smart contracts and getting compensated for the value and risk you contribute. Returns can be variable and depend on protocol incentives, utilization, and market conditions.

## How It Works

### 1) Provide capital to a DeFi protocol

Most yield farming strategies start by depositing tokens into a smart contract:

- **Liquidity pools (AMMs/DEXs):** You deposit two assets (e.g., USDC/SEI) into a pool used for swaps.
- **Lending markets:** You deposit an asset (e.g., USDC) to be lent out to borrowers.
- **Staking/vaults:** You stake tokens directly or deposit into an automated strategy vault that compounds rewards.

In return, you receive a receipt token (often called **LP tokens** for liquidity pools, or **aTokens/cTokens**-like representations in lending markets) that proves your share of the pool.

### 2) Earn yield from one or more sources

Yield can come from:

- **Trading fees:** Liquidity providers earn a portion of swap fees proportional to their pool share.
- **Borrow interest:** Lenders earn interest paid by borrowers (rates fluctuate based on supply/demand).
- **Incentive emissions:** Protocols may distribute extra reward tokens to attract liquidity.
- **MEV/rebates (protocol-dependent):** Some systems share additional revenues with participants.

Yield is usually quoted as:

- **APR (Annual Percentage Rate):** Simple rate, not assuming compounding.
- **APY (Annual Percentage Yield):** Assumes compounding; typically higher than APR.

### 3) Optional: “Farm” additional rewards

Many protocols have a separate “farm” contract where you **stake your LP/receipt tokens** to earn extra incentives.

Common flow:

1. Deposit assets into pool → receive LP tokens
2. Stake LP tokens in farm → earn reward tokens
3. Periodically claim rewards → optionally swap and compound

### 4) Withdraw and realize profits/losses

When you exit:

- Unstake LP/receipt tokens (if applicable)
- Redeem them for underlying assets
- Compare withdrawal value vs deposit value plus rewards

### Key risks to understand

- **Smart contract risk:** Bugs or exploits can cause loss of funds.
- **Impermanent loss (AMM pools):** If prices move, LPs can end up with less value than simply holding the assets.
- **Liquidation risk (leveraged farming):** Borrowing to amplify yield can lead to liquidation if collateral drops.
- **Depegging risk:** Stablecoins can lose their peg.
- **Reward token volatility:** Incentive tokens can drop quickly, reducing real returns.
- **Liquidity and withdrawal constraints:** Some pools have lockups, low liquidity, or slippage on exit.

## On Sei Network

Sei Network is a high-performance Layer 1 with EVM compatibility, designed to support DeFi at scale with fast finality and parallelized execution. In practice, yield farming on Sei looks similar to other EVM ecosystems—users interact with AMMs, lending protocols, and vaults using standard wallets and Solidity-based contracts—while benefiting from Sei’s performance characteristics.

### Why yield farming can be smoother on Sei

- **Fast finality (~400ms):** Actions like depositing, staking LP tokens, claiming rewards, and compounding can confirm quickly, improving the experience for active strategies.
- **Parallelization:** Sei’s architecture can execute many transactions concurrently, helping DeFi apps handle high activity (e.g., popular farms, volatile markets) with better throughput.
- **EVM compatibility:** Existing tooling (Solidity, Hardhat/Foundry, ethers.js) works, making it easier for builders to deploy yield strategies and for users to interact with them.

### Typical yield farming flow on Sei

1. Bridge or acquire tokens on Sei (e.g., USDC and a paired asset).
2. Provide liquidity to a Sei-based DEX → receive LP tokens.
3. Stake LP tokens in a farming contract → earn incentive tokens.
4. Optionally compound rewards back into the pool.
5. Exit by unstaking and removing liquidity.

## Example: Interacting With a Farming Contract (EVM)

Below is a simplified Solidity example of staking an LP token into a farming contract that uses the common `deposit(pid, amount)` pattern.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

interface IERC20 {
    function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    function balanceOf(address owner) external view returns (uint256);
}

interface IFarm {
    function deposit(uint256 pid, uint256 amount) external;
    function withdraw(uint256 pid, uint256 amount) external;
    function pendingRewards(uint256 pid, address user) external view returns (uint256);
}

contract SimpleFarmer {
    IERC20 public immutable lpToken;
    IFarm public immutable farm;
    uint256 public immutable pid;

    constructor(address _lpToken, address _farm, uint256 _pid) {
        lpToken = IERC20(_lpToken);
        farm = IFarm(_farm);
        pid = _pid;
    }

    function stakeAll() external {
        uint256 bal = lpToken.balanceOf(address(this));
        require(bal > 0, "No LP tokens");
        lpToken.approve(address(farm), bal);
        farm.deposit(pid, bal);
    }

    function unstake(uint256 amount) external {
        farm.withdraw(pid, amount);
    }

    function viewPendingRewards() external view returns (uint256) {
        return farm.pendingRewards(pid, address(this));
    }
}
```

## Example: Staking From a Script (TypeScript + ethers)

```typescript
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

const RPC_URL = process.env.SEI_EVM_RPC!;
const PRIVATE_KEY = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY!;
const FARM_ADDRESS = '0xYourFarmContract';
const LP_TOKEN_ADDRESS = '0xYourLPToken';
const PID = 0;

const erc20Abi = ['function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) external returns (bool)', 'function balanceOf(address owner) external view returns (uint256)'];

const farmAbi = ['function deposit(uint256 pid, uint256 amount) external'];

async function main() {
  const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(RPC_URL);
  const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(PRIVATE_KEY, provider);

  const lp = new ethers.Contract(LP_TOKEN_ADDRESS, erc20Abi, wallet);
  const farm = new ethers.Contract(FARM_ADDRESS, farmAbi, wallet);

  const bal: bigint = await lp.balanceOf(wallet.address);
  if (bal === 0n) throw new Error('No LP balance');

  const approveTx = await lp.approve(FARM_ADDRESS, bal);
  await approveTx.wait();

  const depositTx = await farm.deposit(PID, bal);
  await depositTx.wait();

  console.log('Staked LP tokens:', bal.toString());
}

main().catch((e) => {
  console.error(e);
  process.exit(1);
});
```

## Practical Tips

- Prefer established protocols with audits, bug bounties, and transparent risk disclosures.
- Compare **real yield** (fees + incentives minus IL and token volatility), not just headline APY.
- Start small, monitor reward emissions and pool liquidity, and understand withdrawal mechanics.
- Avoid leverage unless you understand liquidation thresholds and oracle dependencies.

## Summary

Yield farming is the practice of earning crypto rewards by supplying assets to DeFi protocols, most commonly through liquidity provision and staking receipt tokens for extra incentives. It works through smart contracts that distribute fees and/or emitted tokens based on your share and time in the protocol. On Sei Network, yield farming follows familiar EVM patterns while benefiting from Sei’s parallelization and fast (~400ms) finality, which can make depositing, claiming, and compounding more responsive under high on-chain activity.
