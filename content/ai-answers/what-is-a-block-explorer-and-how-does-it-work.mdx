## Overview

A block explorer is a web-based tool that lets anyone view and search onchain data—blocks, transactions, addresses, smart contracts, and events—on a blockchain network. It provides transparency by turning raw blockchain records into human-readable pages and searchable indexes.

## How It Works

At a high level, a block explorer is a combination of (1) a node or RPC connection to a blockchain, (2) an indexing service that parses and stores chain data, and (3) a user interface and API for querying that indexed data.

### Core components

- **Blockchain node / RPC endpoint**  
  The explorer reads chain data by running its own node or connecting to one via RPC. Nodes provide access to blocks, transactions, receipts, logs, and state queries.

- **Indexer**  
  The indexer continuously:

  1. Fetches newly produced blocks
  2. Extracts transactions and execution results
  3. Decodes receipts and event logs (if supported)
  4. Stores normalized data in a database for fast lookup (e.g., by tx hash, address, block height)

- **Database + search layer**  
  Because blockchains are append-only and large, explorers maintain their own databases (often SQL + specialized indexing) to enable quick searches and filters.

- **API and UI**  
  Explorers typically expose REST/GraphQL-style endpoints for programmatic access and provide pages for common entities:
  - Block details (height, timestamp, proposer/validator, tx count, gas usage)
  - Transaction details (hash, status, gas used, fees, logs/events, internal calls)
  - Address details (balances, token holdings, transaction history)
  - Contract details (bytecode, verified source code, ABI, read/write methods)

### What you can verify with a block explorer

- **Transaction confirmation and finality**: whether a transaction is included in a block and considered final.
- **Fees and gas usage**: the actual cost paid and gas consumed.
- **Token transfers and contract events**: ERC-20/721/1155 (or equivalent) transfers and emitted logs.
- **Contract interactions**: input data, function calls, and execution outcomes.
- **Network activity**: block times, throughput, and validator/proposer information.

### Typical transaction lifecycle in an explorer

1. A transaction is broadcast to the network (mempool/pending state may be shown if the explorer tracks it).
2. A validator includes it in a block.
3. The block is committed; the explorer indexer ingests it.
4. The explorer displays the transaction as **successful** or **failed** (based on execution result), along with logs/events and state changes where available.

## On Sei Network

Sei Network is a high-performance Layer 1 with EVM compatibility and fast finality (around ~400ms). On Sei, a block explorer serves the same fundamental role—making blocks, transactions, and smart contract activity transparent—but it’s especially useful for observing high-throughput activity enabled by Sei’s parallelization.

### What you’ll commonly inspect on Sei explorers

- **EVM transactions and receipts**: transaction status, gas used, fee paid, and emitted logs (events), similar to Ethereum explorers.
- **Contract deployments and verification**: view contract bytecode and verified Solidity source, then interact using the ABI.
- **Token activity**: transfers, approvals, and contract events for EVM tokens.
- **Fast finality confirmation**: because Sei finalizes quickly, explorers can reflect confirmed state changes rapidly once indexed.

### Parallelization and explorer indexing

Sei’s parallel execution model can process many transactions concurrently. Explorers and their indexers still present results in a deterministic, chain-ordered view (by block and transaction ordering), but you may notice:

- High transaction volume per unit time
- Rapid status transitions from pending to confirmed/final
- Frequent contract events in active applications (e.g., trading, gaming)

## Examples

### Query a transaction by hash (RPC)

Use `eth_getTransactionReceipt` to confirm status and fetch logs:

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://<SEI_EVM_RPC_ENDPOINT> \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id":1,
    "method":"eth_getTransactionReceipt",
    "params":["0xYOUR_TRANSACTION_HASH"]
  }'
```

Key fields to look for:

- `status`: `0x1` success, `0x0` failure
- `blockNumber`, `transactionIndex`: inclusion details
- `gasUsed`: actual execution cost
- `logs`: emitted events (topic/data)

### Find the latest block (RPC)

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://<SEI_EVM_RPC_ENDPOINT> \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id":1,
    "method":"eth_blockNumber",
    "params":[]
  }'
```

### Programmatic lookup with ethers.js (TypeScript)

```typescript
import { JsonRpcProvider } from 'ethers';

const provider = new JsonRpcProvider('https://<SEI_EVM_RPC_ENDPOINT>');

async function inspectTx(txHash: string) {
  const receipt = await provider.getTransactionReceipt(txHash);
  if (!receipt) {
    console.log('Not yet indexed / not found');
    return;
  }

  console.log({
    status: receipt.status, // 1 = success, 0 = failure
    blockNumber: receipt.blockNumber,
    gasUsed: receipt.gasUsed.toString(),
    logs: receipt.logs.length
  });
}

inspectTx('0xYOUR_TRANSACTION_HASH');
```

## Common Explorer Terms

- **Block height / number**: the sequential identifier of a block.
- **Tx hash**: unique identifier of a transaction.
- **From/To**: sender and recipient (or contract) addresses.
- **Gas / gas used**: execution units consumed and the amount actually spent.
- **Fee**: gas used × effective gas price (plus any relevant components).
- **Logs / events**: records emitted by smart contracts during execution.
- **Internal transactions / traces**: contract-to-contract calls (when trace support is enabled by the explorer).

## Why Block Explorers Matter

- **Transparency and auditability**: independently verify activity without trusting an application UI.
- **Debugging and development**: inspect reverted transactions, event logs, and contract calls.
- **Security and monitoring**: track token movements, approvals, and suspicious behavior.
- **User support**: share transaction links to prove payment, swaps, mints, or contract interactions.
