# What is a Genesis Block and How Does It Work?

## Overview

A **genesis block** is the **first block** in a blockchain and serves as the starting point for the network’s entire transaction history. It is typically **hardcoded or created at chain launch** and establishes the initial state (such as initial balances, parameters, and validator set) that every node agrees on.

In other words, when someone asks **“what is genesis block”**, the answer is: it’s the foundational block that anchors the chain’s identity and defines the initial conditions from which all subsequent blocks are built.

## How It Works

### 1) The genesis block defines the initial state

Before a blockchain can produce blocks, nodes must agree on a shared “starting snapshot.” The genesis block (or genesis configuration that produces it) sets:

- **Chain identity** (e.g., chain ID / network ID)
- **Consensus parameters** (block times, validator rules, slashing settings, etc.)
- **Initial accounts and balances** (pre-mined allocations, foundation/community funds)
- **Initial validator set** (for Proof-of-Stake networks)
- **System modules / protocol settings** (staking, governance, fee parameters)

This ensures that independent nodes starting from scratch can reproduce the same initial state deterministically.

### 2) It’s typically not “mined” like later blocks

Many networks treat the genesis block as a **special case**:

- It may not contain normal transactions.
- It may have a fixed height (usually **height 0** or **height 1**, depending on the implementation).
- Its hash and contents are often **known in advance** and shipped as part of node software or configuration.

### 3) It anchors chain security and verification

A node syncing a blockchain relies on:

- The **genesis state** to initialize its local database.
- Subsequent blocks being validated against consensus rules that the genesis block established.

If two nodes use different genesis configurations (even slightly), they will compute different state roots and effectively be on **different networks** (a “different chain”).

### 4) Genesis vs. forks and restarts

- A **hard fork** usually updates protocol rules while preserving history (same genesis).
- A **new chain / restart** often creates a **new genesis** (new chain ID and initial state), even if it shares code or community.

## On Sei Network

Sei Network is a high-performance Layer 1 with **parallelized execution**, **fast finality (~400ms)**, and **EVM compatibility**. On Sei, the genesis block plays the same foundational role—defining the initial state and parameters—but it also matters specifically for:

- **Chain identity for EVM and Cosmos layers**: Sei runs a Cosmos SDK-based chain with EVM compatibility, and the genesis configuration sets the chain ID and module parameters that clients and tooling (including EVM tooling) rely on.
- **Validator set and staking parameters**: As a Proof-of-Stake network, Sei’s genesis establishes the initial validator set and staking/governance configuration that enables secure block production from the first moment.
- **Deterministic startup for high-throughput execution**: Sei’s parallelization and rapid finality depend on nodes starting from an identical genesis state so that transaction execution and state transitions remain consistent across all participants.

Practically, if you deploy infrastructure or build on Sei, you must ensure your node and tooling reference the **correct genesis file** for the intended network (e.g., mainnet vs testnet), because the genesis determines the chain you are connecting to.

## Common Properties of a Genesis Block

- **No parent block**: It has no previous hash to reference.
- **Fixed height**: The first height in the chain’s history.
- **Network-defining**: Changing genesis parameters produces a different network.
- **Often includes initial allocations**: Establishes initial token distribution and module state.

## How to Inspect a Chain’s Genesis (Examples)

### Using a Cosmos SDK-style node CLI (common for Sei-based networks)

If you run a node locally, you can typically view the genesis file like this:

```bash
# Path may vary by installation; commonly under a node's home directory
cat ~/.seid/config/genesis.json | head
```

To search for key sections:

```bash
cat ~/.seid/config/genesis.json | jq '.chain_id'
cat ~/.seid/config/genesis.json | jq '.app_state.staking.params'
cat ~/.seid/config/genesis.json | jq '.app_state.bank.balances[:5]'
```

### Verifying you’re on the expected chain

Chain ID is a quick sanity check that you’re using the correct genesis/network:

```bash
seid status 2>/dev/null | jq '.NodeInfo.network'
```

> Note: Command names/paths can vary depending on your Sei node setup and version. The key concept is that the **genesis.json** defines the starting configuration the node uses to join a specific Sei network.

## Why the Genesis Block Matters

- **Consensus alignment**: All validators and full nodes must share the same genesis to agree on state and produce blocks.
- **Network separation**: Different genesis files separate mainnets, testnets, and private networks.
- **Protocol initialization**: Governance, staking, and system modules can only operate correctly if their initial parameters are set at genesis.
- **Trust and transparency**: Public networks often publish the genesis so anyone can independently verify the network’s initial conditions.

## Summary

A genesis block is the first block (or initial state configuration) that bootstraps a blockchain, defining critical parameters like chain identity, consensus rules, and starting balances. In Sei Network, the genesis is especially important because it underpins a fast-finality (~400ms), parallelized Layer 1 with EVM compatibility—ensuring every node starts from the same state and can validate and execute blocks consistently.
