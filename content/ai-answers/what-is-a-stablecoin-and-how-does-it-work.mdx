## Overview

A **stablecoin** is a cryptocurrency designed to maintain a relatively stable value, most commonly by tracking a reference asset like the **US dollar (USD)**. Unlike volatile crypto assets, stablecoins aim to provide predictable pricing for payments, trading, and on-chain financial applications.

Stablecoins are typically issued as tokens on a blockchain and use collateral, reserves, and/or market incentives to keep their price close to a target (e.g., **1 stablecoin ≈ $1**).

## How It Works

Stablecoins maintain stability through one of several common models:

### Fiat-backed (reserve-backed) stablecoins

These stablecoins are backed by off-chain reserves held by a custodian (e.g., cash, Treasury bills).

- **Mechanism:** A centralized issuer mints new tokens when users deposit fiat (or equivalent), and burns tokens when users redeem for fiat.
- **Pros:** Often the most price-stable and liquid.
- **Cons:** Requires trusting the issuer and custodians; relies on audits/attestations and regulatory compliance.

**Typical flow:**

1. User deposits $1 with the issuer.
2. Issuer mints 1 token on-chain and sends it to the user.
3. User redeems 1 token later; issuer burns it and returns $1.

### Crypto-collateralized stablecoins

These stablecoins are backed by on-chain collateral (often volatile crypto) held in smart contracts, usually with **overcollateralization** to absorb price swings.

- **Mechanism:** Users lock collateral in a vault and borrow/mint stablecoins against it (e.g., deposit $150 of collateral to mint $100 of stablecoins).
- **Stability tools:** Liquidations, collateral ratios, and price oracles.
- **Pros:** More decentralized; transparent collateral on-chain.
- **Cons:** Depends on oracle integrity and liquidation efficiency; can be stressed by rapid market moves.

### Algorithmic / hybrid stablecoins

These attempt to maintain a peg primarily through market incentives and token supply adjustments rather than fully backed reserves.

- **Mechanism:** Protocol expands/contracts supply or uses dual-token designs to influence price.
- **Pros:** Capital-efficient in theory.
- **Cons:** Can be fragile under extreme market conditions; higher risk profile.

### Keeping the peg: arbitrage and market forces

Regardless of model, **arbitrage** is a key stabilizer:

- If a $1 stablecoin trades at **$1.02**, traders can mint/redeem (if allowed) or sell to push it down.
- If it trades at **$0.98**, traders can buy and redeem or reduce supply to push it up.

## On Sei Network

On **Sei Network**, stablecoins are used throughout payments, trading, and DeFi—benefiting from Sei’s **high throughput**, **parallelized execution**, and **~400ms finality**, which can reduce latency and improve UX for stablecoin-based activity.

Key points for stablecoins on Sei:

- **EVM compatibility:** Many stablecoin integrations and DeFi patterns from Ethereum can be deployed on Sei’s EVM environment with familiar tooling (e.g., Solidity and standard ERC-20 interfaces).
- **Fast finality for payments:** Near-instant finality helps stablecoin transfers settle quickly—useful for merchant payments, exchanges, and cross-app routing.
- **Parallelization at scale:** High-volume stablecoin use cases (swaps, lending, order routing, on-chain treasury operations) can benefit when many transactions can be processed efficiently in parallel.

### Example: Interacting with an ERC-20 stablecoin on Sei (Solidity)

Below is a minimal example showing how a contract might accept a stablecoin payment using the standard ERC-20 interface:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

interface IERC20 {
    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    function balanceOf(address owner) external view returns (uint256);
}

contract StablecoinCheckout {
    IERC20 public immutable stablecoin;
    address public immutable merchant;

    constructor(address stablecoin_, address merchant_) {
        stablecoin = IERC20(stablecoin_);
        merchant = merchant_;
    }

    function pay(uint256 amount) external {
        require(amount > 0, "amount=0");
        // User must approve this contract to spend `amount` first
        bool ok = stablecoin.transferFrom(msg.sender, merchant, amount);
        require(ok, "transfer failed");
    }
}
```

### Example: Sending a stablecoin transfer with ethers (TypeScript)

```typescript
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

const rpcUrl = process.env.RPC_URL!;
const privateKey = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY!;
const stablecoinAddress = '0xYourStablecoinERC20';
const recipient = '0xRecipient';
const amount = '10.0'; // 10 stablecoins

const erc20Abi = ['function decimals() view returns (uint8)', 'function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) returns (bool)'];

async function main() {
  const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(rpcUrl);
  const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(privateKey, provider);

  const token = new ethers.Contract(stablecoinAddress, erc20Abi, wallet);
  const decimals: number = await token.decimals();

  const value = ethers.parseUnits(amount, decimals);
  const tx = await token.transfer(recipient, value);
  await tx.wait();

  console.log('Sent:', amount, 'tx:', tx.hash);
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

## Common Uses

- **Trading and liquidity:** Quote currency for swaps and order books; reduces exposure to volatility.
- **Payments and payroll:** Faster settlement than traditional rails while staying denominated in a stable unit.
- **DeFi building block:** Collateral, lending/borrowing, yield strategies, and on-chain treasury management.
- **Cross-border transfers:** Move value globally with predictable pricing.

## Key Risks and Considerations

- **Issuer/custody risk (fiat-backed):** Solvency, reserve quality, and redemption policies matter.
- **Smart contract and oracle risk (crypto-backed):** Bugs, oracle manipulation, and liquidation failures can impact the peg.
- **Depeg risk:** Market stress, liquidity issues, or redemption constraints can cause a stablecoin to trade below/above target.
- **Regulatory and compliance risk:** Rules vary by jurisdiction and may affect issuance and access.

## Summary

Stablecoins are tokens designed to hold a stable price—most often around $1—using reserves, on-chain collateral systems, or algorithmic mechanisms supported by arbitrage. On Sei Network, stablecoins can power fast, scalable transfers and DeFi apps, leveraging Sei’s **parallelized performance**, **~400ms finality**, and **EVM compatibility** for familiar developer workflows.
