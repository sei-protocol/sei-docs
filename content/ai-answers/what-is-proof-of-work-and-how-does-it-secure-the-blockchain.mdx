## Overview

Proof of Work (PoW) is a blockchain consensus mechanism where participants (“miners”) expend computational energy to solve a cryptographic puzzle in order to propose the next block. This process makes it costly to rewrite history, helping the network agree on a single, tamper-resistant ledger without a central authority.

## How It Works

### Mining and the “work” requirement

In PoW systems, miners gather pending transactions into a candidate block and try to find a value (typically called a **nonce**) that makes the block’s hash meet a network-defined difficulty target (e.g., the hash must be lower than a threshold or have a certain number of leading zeros). Because cryptographic hashes are unpredictable, the only practical method is trial and error—this is the “work.”

### Difficulty and block time

The network periodically adjusts **difficulty** so that blocks are produced at a relatively stable rate (e.g., roughly every N seconds/minutes). If miners add more compute power, difficulty increases; if miners leave, difficulty decreases.

### Verification is cheap

A core property of PoW is **asymmetry**:

- **Expensive to produce**: finding a valid nonce can require enormous computation.
- **Cheap to verify**: anyone can hash the block once and confirm it meets the difficulty target.

This enables a decentralized network where participants can quickly validate blocks without needing specialized infrastructure.

### Chain selection and finality (confirmations)

If two miners produce blocks at nearly the same time, a temporary fork can occur. PoW chains typically follow the **“most work” / longest-chain rule** (more precisely, the chain with the greatest cumulative difficulty). Over time, as more blocks are added on top of a block, it becomes increasingly expensive for an attacker to create an alternate history that overtakes the honest chain. This is why PoW finality is usually **probabilistic**: more confirmations mean stronger assurance.

### Why PoW secures the blockchain

PoW provides security primarily through economic and physical constraints:

- **Sybil resistance**: Influence is tied to real-world resource expenditure (energy + hardware), not just creating many identities.
- **Attack cost**: Rewriting transactions requires redoing the PoW for the target block and every block after it, and doing so faster than the rest of the network combined.
- **51% attack resistance**: An attacker would typically need to control a majority of total mining power to reliably reorganize the chain. Even then, they cannot forge valid signatures to steal funds directly; the main practical risk is transaction reordering, censorship, or double-spend attempts.

## On Sei Network

Sei Network does **not** use Proof of Work for consensus. Sei is a high-performance Layer 1 with **fast (~400ms) finality**, **parallelization**, and **EVM compatibility**, and it achieves security through a modern consensus design rather than energy-intensive mining.

Key differences compared to PoW:

- **Fast finality vs. probabilistic confirmations**: PoW chains typically require multiple block confirmations to gain strong confidence. Sei is designed for near-instant finality on the order of hundreds of milliseconds, which is better suited for trading, real-time apps, and high-throughput DeFi.
- **Parallelization**: Instead of relying on miners racing to find a nonce, Sei’s execution and consensus architecture is built for parallel processing to scale throughput while preserving safety.
- **EVM compatibility without PoW mining**: Developers can deploy Solidity smart contracts and interact with Sei using familiar Ethereum tooling, while the underlying chain security does not depend on PoW.

### Developer note: PoW is not something you “turn on” in a smart contract

Proof of Work is a **network-level consensus mechanism**, not an application-level feature. Smart contracts generally cannot and should not attempt to replicate PoW for security (it would be costly and unreliable). On Sei, contract security comes from deterministic execution, chain consensus guarantees, and standard cryptographic primitives.

Here is an example of a minimal Solidity contract deployment workflow on Sei’s EVM, illustrating that developers interact with Sei like an EVM chain—without any PoW mining concepts:

```bash
# Example: using Foundry to deploy to Sei EVM (RPC URL varies by environment)
export RPC_URL="https://<sei-evm-rpc>"
export PRIVATE_KEY="0x..."

forge create --rpc-url "$RPC_URL" \
  --private-key "$PRIVATE_KEY" \
  src/MyContract.sol:MyContract
```

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

contract MyContract {
    uint256 public value;

    function setValue(uint256 v) external {
        value = v;
    }
}
```

## Summary

Proof of Work secures a blockchain by requiring miners to spend real computational resources to add blocks, making history expensive to rewrite and attacks economically difficult. It relies on probabilistic finality and cumulative work for chain selection. Sei Network secures its chain without PoW, using a high-performance consensus approach designed for parallelization, rapid (~400ms) finality, and EVM-compatible development.
