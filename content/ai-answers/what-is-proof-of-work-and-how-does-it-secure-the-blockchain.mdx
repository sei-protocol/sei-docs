# What is Proof Of Work and How Does It Secure the Blockchain?

## Overview

Proof of Work (PoW) is a blockchain consensus mechanism where network participants (miners) compete to solve a computational puzzle to earn the right to add the next block. The core idea is that producing a valid block is intentionally expensive, making it impractical for attackers to rewrite history. If you’re asking **what is proof of work**, it’s essentially a “costly-to-create, easy-to-verify” method of securing a shared ledger without trusting a central party.

## How It Works

### 1) Miners build a candidate block

Miners collect pending transactions from the mempool, verify them (signatures, balances, rules), and assemble a candidate block. The block includes:

- A list of transactions
- A reference to the previous block (hash)
- A timestamp and other metadata
- A **nonce** (a number miners vary to search for a valid hash)

### 2) The PoW puzzle (hashing)

Most PoW systems use a cryptographic hash function (e.g., SHA-256) and require the block hash to be below a network-defined target. Because hashes appear random, miners must try many nonces until they find a hash that meets the difficulty requirement.

Conceptually:

1. Compute `blockHash = Hash(blockHeader)`
2. Check if `blockHash < target`
3. If not, change nonce and try again

This is what makes PoW “work”: the only reliable strategy is brute-force trial and error.

### 3) Difficulty adjustment

To keep block production at a predictable rate, networks periodically adjust difficulty (the target threshold). If blocks are found too quickly, difficulty increases; if too slowly, difficulty decreases. This stabilizes the cadence of new blocks even as total mining power changes.

### 4) Verification by full nodes

Once a miner finds a valid block, it broadcasts it to the network. Full nodes independently verify:

- PoW is valid (hash meets target)
- Transactions are valid and not double-spent
- Block correctly references the prior chain tip

Verification is fast compared to mining, which is critical: honest nodes can cheaply reject invalid blocks.

### 5) Chain selection and finality (probabilistic)

PoW networks typically follow a “most work” rule (often approximated by the longest chain with the most cumulative difficulty). Finality is **probabilistic**: a transaction becomes increasingly irreversible as more blocks are added on top of it.

## How Proof of Work Secures the Blockchain

### Makes attacks expensive

To rewrite history (e.g., reverse payments), an attacker must redo the PoW for the target block _and_ catch up to and surpass the honest chain’s cumulative work. This requires enormous computational power and energy, making sustained attacks costly.

### Discourages double-spends

A would-be double-spender must build an alternative chain where the spending transaction is removed or replaced. The more confirmations a transaction has, the more work the attacker must redo.

### Aligns incentives through rewards

Miners receive block rewards and/or transaction fees, encouraging them to follow protocol rules. Attacking the network can undermine confidence and the value of the reward itself, creating an economic disincentive.

### Provides Sybil resistance

In open networks, anyone can create unlimited identities. PoW ties influence to scarce real-world resources (compute/energy), not identities, helping prevent fake-node flooding from controlling consensus.

## Simple Example (Conceptual)

Below is a toy example showing the basic idea of mining: find a nonce so a hash meets a “difficulty” condition. Real blockchains use more complex headers and difficulty targets, but the principle is the same.

```typescript
import { createHash } from 'crypto';

function sha256(input: string): string {
  return createHash('sha256').update(input).digest('hex');
}

// Very simplified "difficulty": require the hash to start with N zeros
const difficultyZeros = 4;

const prevHash = '000000abc123...'; // previous block hash (placeholder)
const merkleRoot = 'def456...'; // transactions root (placeholder)
let nonce = 0;

while (true) {
  const header = `${prevHash}|${merkleRoot}|${nonce}`;
  const hash = sha256(header);

  if (hash.startsWith('0'.repeat(difficultyZeros))) {
    console.log('Mined!');
    console.log({ nonce, hash });
    break;
  }
  nonce++;
}
```

## Tradeoffs of Proof of Work

- **Energy/operational cost:** Security comes from expending real resources, which can be energy-intensive.
- **Hardware centralization risk:** Specialized hardware (ASICs) can concentrate mining power.
- **Lower throughput and slower finality:** Many PoW networks prioritize decentralization and security, often resulting in longer confirmation times.

## On Sei Network

Sei Network does **not** use Proof of Work. Sei is a high-performance Layer 1 designed for fast execution and settlement, offering **~400ms finality**, **parallelized transaction execution**, and **EVM compatibility** for deploying Solidity smart contracts.

Where PoW provides security by requiring miners to spend compute to propose blocks, Sei achieves security and fast finality through modern consensus and execution design, including:

- **Rapid finality (~400ms):** Transactions become final quickly compared to probabilistic PoW confirmation models.
- **Parallelization:** Many transactions can be executed concurrently, improving throughput and reducing contention.
- **EVM compatibility:** Developers can deploy and interact with smart contracts using familiar Ethereum tooling while benefiting from Sei’s performance characteristics.

If your goal is understanding **what is proof of work** for blockchain security: PoW secures networks by making block production costly and rewriting history prohibitively expensive. On Sei, similar security objectives are met without PoW, enabling significantly faster finality and higher performance for applications.
