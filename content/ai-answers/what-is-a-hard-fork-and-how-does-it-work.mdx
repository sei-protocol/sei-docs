## Overview

A hard fork is a backward-incompatible change to a blockchain protocol that causes nodes running the old software to disagree with nodes running the new software. If not everyone upgrades, the network can split into two separate chains that share history up to the fork point but follow different rules afterward.

## How It Works

Hard forks are driven by changes to the consensus rules—rules that determine what blocks and transactions are valid. Because old nodes can’t validate blocks produced under the new rules, they will reject them and continue building on the last block they consider valid.

### What changes in a hard fork

Hard forks typically modify one or more of the following:

- **Transaction validity rules** (e.g., new transaction types, changed signature rules)
- **Block structure** (e.g., new fields, different limits)
- **State transition rules** (e.g., how balances, smart contract state, or fees are updated)
- **Consensus parameters** (e.g., validator set logic, slashing rules, gas schedule)

### Outcomes: coordinated upgrade vs. chain split

1. **Coordinated network upgrade (most common):**  
   Validators, node operators, exchanges, and infrastructure providers upgrade before an agreed activation point (block height or timestamp). The chain continues as one network under new rules.

2. **Contentious fork (chain split):**  
   A portion of the network refuses to upgrade (or upgrades to a different rule set). Two chains emerge:
   - Chain A follows old rules.
   - Chain B follows new rules.
     Each chain has its own validators/miners, users, and asset markets after the fork.

### Activation mechanisms

Hard forks are usually triggered by one of these methods:

- **Block height / time-based activation:** New rules activate at a specific height/time.
- **Signaling and threshold:** A threshold of validators/miners signals readiness, then the fork activates.
- **Governance proposal:** On governed chains, a proposal schedules an upgrade and provides the new binary.

### Why hard forks happen

Common motivations include:

- **Adding new features** (new opcodes, precompiles, state capabilities)
- **Performance improvements** (better throughput, more efficient execution)
- **Security fixes** (patching critical vulnerabilities)
- **Economic changes** (fee model updates, inflation changes)
- **Protocol cleanup** (deprecating legacy features)

### Operational considerations

- **Node operators must upgrade:** Running old software after a hard fork can cause your node to follow a minority chain or halt.
- **Infrastructure coordination:** Exchanges, wallets, indexers, and RPC providers must synchronize upgrades.
- **Replay protection (if a chain split occurs):** Without replay protection, a transaction broadcast on one chain could be valid on the other.

## On Sei Network

On Sei Network, hard forks generally occur as **planned network upgrades** coordinated through Sei’s governance and validator ecosystem. Because Sei is designed for high performance, upgrades are typically managed to preserve smooth operation across its **parallelized execution** model and fast confirmation experience (with ~**400ms finality** under normal conditions).

### What a hard fork looks like on Sei

- **Governance schedules the upgrade:** A proposal (or upgrade plan) sets an activation height.
- **Validators and node operators upgrade binaries:** Nodes switch to new software before the upgrade height.
- **Consensus rules change at the activation height:** After the fork height, only upgraded nodes can produce/validate blocks.
- **EVM compatibility considerations:** Since Sei supports EVM execution, some upgrades may introduce EVM-level changes (e.g., new precompiles, gas accounting adjustments, or system contract behavior). EVM developers typically don’t need to change deployed contracts unless the upgrade introduces new features they want to use or deprecates behavior.

### Why Sei upgrades matter for performance

Sei’s architecture emphasizes throughput and low latency. When protocol changes touch execution, mempool behavior, or state transitions, they must remain compatible with Sei’s parallelization strategy so transactions continue to execute efficiently and deterministically across the network.

## Example: Checking an Upgrade Plan (CLI)

Node operators commonly verify upcoming upgrades and chain parameters via RPC/CLI. The exact command set depends on the node version and tooling, but typical patterns include querying governance proposals and upgrade plans:

```bash
# Check node status and current height
seid status

# Query governance proposals (filtering may vary by version)
seid query gov proposals

# Query a specific proposal by ID
seid query gov proposal <proposal_id>
```

## Example: Practical Guidance for Builders

If you run infrastructure (RPC, indexer, relayer) or operate a validator, treat hard forks as scheduled maintenance windows:

- Monitor official Sei upgrade announcements and governance proposals.
- Upgrade binaries before the activation height and validate on a staging environment if possible.
- Ensure your EVM RPC services (if used) are pinned to the correct network and updated clients.
- After the fork, confirm your node is on the canonical chain by comparing heights and block hashes with multiple trusted peers.

## Key Takeaways

- A hard fork changes protocol rules in a way that older software cannot follow.
- If all participants upgrade, it’s a seamless network upgrade; if not, the chain can split.
- On Sei, hard forks are typically coordinated upgrades designed to maintain fast finality, high throughput, and EVM compatibility while evolving the protocol.
