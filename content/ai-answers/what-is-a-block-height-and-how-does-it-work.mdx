## Overview

**Block height** is the sequential number assigned to a block in a blockchain, indicating its position relative to the first block (the _genesis_ block). It’s a simple, widely used way to reference “how many blocks have been added” and to locate a specific block in the chain. Block height is foundational for tracking chain progress, confirmations, and synchronization.

## How It Works

### Sequential indexing from genesis

- The **genesis block** is the first block and is typically at **height 0** (some tools may display it as 1, depending on conventions).
- Each subsequent block increments the height by 1:
  - If the latest block is at height **10,000**, there are **10,001** blocks from height 0 through 10,000.

### Relationship to confirmations and finality

- A transaction is included in a block at some height `H`.
- As new blocks are appended (`H+1`, `H+2`, …), the transaction gains **confirmations** (often approximated as `currentHeight - H + 1`).
- In probabilistic-finality systems, more confirmations typically mean higher confidence the transaction won’t be reverted due to a reorg.

### Handling forks and reorganizations

In some networks, two competing blocks can briefly exist at the same height (a fork). Eventually, the chain selects a canonical branch, and blocks on the discarded branch are “orphaned,” even though they had valid heights. This is why some applications wait for multiple confirmations before treating a transaction as settled.

### Common uses of block height

- **State snapshots:** “State as of height `H`.”
- **Event indexing:** Off-chain indexers track logs/events by block height ranges.
- **Time approximation:** Height can approximate time when average block times are stable.
- **Protocol rules:** Upgrades and parameter changes may be scheduled at specific heights.

## On Sei Network

### Fast, predictable settlement cadence

On **Sei**, block height increments as blocks are produced, and Sei’s **~400ms finality** (fast settlement) means applications can often treat transactions as finalized quickly after inclusion. For user experiences like trading or real-time apps, this reduces the need to wait for many additional blocks compared with slower chains.

### High throughput via parallelization

Sei’s **parallelization** allows the network to process many transactions efficiently within blocks. While block height remains a simple sequential counter, the work done per block can be substantial, which is useful for high-frequency use cases and large-scale event indexing.

### EVM compatibility and familiar tooling

Because Sei is **EVM-compatible**, developers can use Ethereum-style RPC methods to query block height (e.g., `eth_blockNumber`) and retrieve blocks by number, making it straightforward to integrate wallets, indexers, and analytics tools.

## Practical Examples

### Get the current block height (EVM RPC)

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://YOUR_SEI_EVM_RPC \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}'
```

### Read the block number (height) in Solidity

In EVM environments, `block.number` is the current block number (commonly used as “block height” in smart contracts).

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

contract BlockHeightExample {
    function currentHeight() external view returns (uint256) {
        return block.number;
    }

    function ageInBlocks(uint256 includedAt) external view returns (uint256) {
        require(block.number >= includedAt, "Future height");
        return block.number - includedAt;
    }
}
```

### Query a specific block by height (EVM RPC)

```bash
# Replace 0xA1B2C3 with a hex-encoded block number
curl -s -X POST https://YOUR_SEI_EVM_RPC \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getBlockByNumber","params":["0xA1B2C3", false],"id":1}'
```

### Get the current block height (Cosmos-style RPC)

If you’re using Sei’s Cosmos-side endpoints, you can fetch the latest block and read its height.

```bash
curl -s https://YOUR_SEI_REST_ENDPOINT/cosmos/base/tendermint/v1beta1/blocks/latest
```

## Key Takeaways

- Block height is the **position of a block** in the blockchain, counted sequentially from genesis.
- It’s used for **confirmations**, **syncing**, **indexing**, and **protocol scheduling**.
- On Sei, block height remains the same core concept, but benefits from **fast finality (~400ms)**, **parallelized execution**, and **EVM-compatible** querying and developer tooling.
