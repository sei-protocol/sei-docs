## Overview

A **flash loan** is a type of uncollateralized loan that must be **borrowed and repaid within the same blockchain transaction**. If the loan isn’t repaid (plus fees) before the transaction ends, the entire transaction **reverts**, as if it never happened.

Flash loans enable sophisticated, short-lived strategies—like arbitrage or collateral swaps—without requiring the borrower to lock up capital upfront.

## How It Works

Flash loans rely on a core property of blockchains: **atomic transactions**. Atomicity means a transaction either completes fully or fails completely.

### Core mechanics

1. **Borrow** funds from a flash-loan-enabled liquidity pool (e.g., a lending protocol).
2. **Use** the borrowed funds immediately within the same transaction:
   - Arbitrage across DEXs
   - Refinance debt positions
   - Swap collateral types
   - Liquidate unhealthy positions (and keep liquidation incentives)
3. **Repay** the borrowed amount plus a fee before the transaction completes.
4. If repayment doesn’t happen, the protocol triggers a **revert**, undoing every state change made in the transaction.

### Why no collateral is needed

Because repayment is enforced by the transaction’s atomicity, the lender’s risk is minimized: either the funds are returned in the same transaction, or the transaction fails and the lender’s funds never leave the pool in a finalized state.

### Common use cases

- **Arbitrage:** Buy an asset cheap on one DEX and sell it higher on another.
- **Collateral swap:** Move a lending position from one collateral asset to another without closing it manually.
- **Debt refinancing:** Repay debt in one protocol and open a new position elsewhere in one transaction.
- **Liquidations:** Use borrowed funds to liquidate an undercollateralized position and capture liquidation bonuses.

### Risks and considerations

- **Smart contract risk:** Flash loans are usually accessed programmatically; bugs can lead to losses.
- **MEV and competition:** Arbitrage and liquidation opportunities are highly competitive; transactions can be frontrun or backrun.
- **Oracle and pricing risks:** If protocols rely on manipulable pricing sources, flash loans can amplify exploitability (the loan itself isn’t the vulnerability—weak pricing/oracle design is).

## On Sei Network

On **Sei Network**, flash loans follow the same atomic transaction principle, with practical advantages from Sei’s architecture:

- **Fast finality (~400ms):** Strategies that depend on timely execution (like arbitrage) benefit from quicker confirmation and reduced time-to-finality uncertainty.
- **Parallelization:** Sei’s ability to execute non-conflicting transactions in parallel can improve overall throughput during periods of high activity—important for markets where many bots compete for the same opportunities.
- **EVM compatibility:** Developers can build or integrate flash-loan-capable protocols using familiar Ethereum tooling, patterns, and Solidity interfaces.

In practice, a flash loan on Sei is typically exposed by a lending or liquidity protocol as an EVM contract method that:

1. transfers funds to a receiver contract,
2. calls back into that receiver to execute logic, and
3. verifies repayment before allowing the transaction to complete.

## Example (Solidity)

Below is a simplified EVM-style flash loan receiver pattern. The exact interfaces vary by protocol, but the flow is representative: request the loan, execute logic in a callback, then repay.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

interface IERC20 {
    function balanceOf(address) external view returns (uint256);
    function transfer(address, uint256) external returns (bool);
    function approve(address, uint256) external returns (bool);
}

interface IFlashLender {
    function flashLoan(
        address receiver,
        address token,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes calldata data
    ) external;
}

/// @notice Example receiver contract for a flash lender.
/// The lender calls `onFlashLoan` during the same transaction.
contract FlashLoanReceiver {
    address public immutable lender;

    constructor(address _lender) {
        lender = _lender;
    }

    function executeFlashLoan(address token, uint256 amount, bytes calldata data) external {
        IFlashLender(lender).flashLoan(address(this), token, amount, data);
        // If we reach here, the loan was repaid within the same tx.
    }

    /// @dev Callback invoked by the lender after transferring `amount` to this contract.
    /// The receiver must return funds + fee to the lender before the transaction ends.
    function onFlashLoan(
        address initiator,
        address token,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 fee,
        bytes calldata /* data */
    ) external returns (bytes32) {
        require(msg.sender == lender, "unauthorized lender");
        require(initiator == address(this), "unauthorized initiator");

        // 1) Use the funds (arbitrage, liquidation, collateral swap, etc.)
        // Example placeholder: do nothing.

        // 2) Repay principal + fee
        IERC20(token).transfer(lender, amount + fee);

        // Return value is lender-specific; this is a common pattern.
        return keccak256("FLASHLOAN_SUCCESS");
    }
}
```

## Example (TypeScript with Ethers)

This illustrates calling a receiver contract that triggers a flash loan. You’ll adapt the ABI and parameters to the specific Sei EVM protocol you’re using.

```typescript
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

const RPC_URL = process.env.SEI_EVM_RPC!;
const PRIVATE_KEY = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY!;

const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(RPC_URL);
const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(PRIVATE_KEY, provider);

const receiverAddress = '0xYourReceiverContract';
const receiverAbi = ['function executeFlashLoan(address token, uint256 amount, bytes data) external'];

async function main() {
  const receiver = new ethers.Contract(receiverAddress, receiverAbi, wallet);

  const token = '0xTokenAddress';
  const amount = ethers.parseUnits('1000', 6); // example: 1000 units with 6 decimals
  const data = '0x';

  const tx = await receiver.executeFlashLoan(token, amount, data);
  const receipt = await tx.wait();

  console.log('Flash loan tx hash:', receipt?.hash);
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

## Key Takeaways

- Flash loans are **uncollateralized** because repayment is enforced by **atomic execution** within a single transaction.
- They are primarily used for **arbitrage, liquidations, and refinancing** workflows that benefit from short-term liquidity.
- On **Sei**, flash loans can be implemented via **EVM smart contracts**, benefiting from **~400ms finality** and **parallelized execution** that support high-throughput DeFi activity.
