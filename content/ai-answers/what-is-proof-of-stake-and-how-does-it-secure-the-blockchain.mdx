## Overview

Proof of Stake (PoS) is a blockchain consensus mechanism where validators secure the network by locking up (“staking”) tokens and participating in block production and verification. Instead of using energy-intensive mining, PoS relies on economic incentives: honest behavior is rewarded, and malicious behavior can be penalized (slashed).

PoS secures a blockchain by making attacks economically expensive and by enabling the network to quickly finalize blocks once enough validators agree on the chain’s state.

## How It Works

### 1) Validators stake tokens to join consensus

Participants become validators by bonding a stake. The stake acts as collateral: validators earn rewards for correctly proposing/attesting to blocks, and risk losing stake if they violate protocol rules.

### 2) Proposer selection and voting/attestation

Most PoS designs follow a pattern:

- A validator is selected (often weighted by stake) to **propose** the next block.
- Other validators **attest** (vote) that the proposed block is valid and that it extends the correct chain.

This makes block creation a coordinated process among many independent parties, rather than a race to compute hashes.

### 3) Finality: making blocks irreversible (economically and technically)

Many modern PoS systems provide **finality**, meaning that once a block is finalized, reverting it would require an extremely large portion of validators to collude and accept severe penalties. Finality reduces reorg risk and gives users confidence that transactions won’t be undone after confirmation.

### 4) Incentives: rewards and penalties (slashing)

PoS aligns validator incentives with network security:

- **Rewards**: validators earn newly issued tokens and/or transaction fees for honest participation.
- **Penalties**: validators can be penalized for being offline (liveness faults) and **slashed** for provable misbehavior (safety faults), such as:
  - **Double signing**: signing two competing blocks at the same height
  - **Surround voting / equivocation** (in some finality gadgets): conflicting votes that break consensus rules

Because stake is at risk, attacking the chain requires risking significant capital, and successful attacks can be met with slashing—making them unattractive.

### 5) Delegation (optional but common)

Many PoS networks allow token holders to **delegate** stake to validators. Delegators share in rewards and may share in penalties, while validators run infrastructure and participate directly in consensus.

## How Proof of Stake Secures the Blockchain

### Economic security: attacks require costly stake

To rewrite history or censor transactions, an attacker typically needs to control a large fraction of the staked tokens. Acquiring and risking that stake is expensive, and any detected malicious activity can trigger slashing—destroying attacker capital.

### Cryptographic accountability: misbehavior can be proven

Consensus messages (block signatures, votes) are signed. If a validator signs conflicting messages, the evidence is publicly verifiable, enabling deterministic punishment.

### Distributed trust: many validators, independent operators

Security improves as stake and voting power are distributed across many validators and delegators, reducing the chance that any single party can dominate consensus.

### Fast finality reduces reorg windows

Finality mechanisms shrink the time window in which reorganizations are possible, improving user safety for exchanges, bridges, and DeFi protocols that depend on transaction irreversibility.

## On Sei Network

Sei Network uses Proof of Stake to secure the chain via a validator set that stakes SEI and participates in consensus. Validators propose and validate blocks, and the protocol uses economic incentives and penalties to enforce correct behavior.

Key PoS-related characteristics on Sei include:

- **Fast finality (~400ms)**: Sei is engineered for very low-latency confirmations, which improves user experience and reduces the practical risk window for chain reorganizations.
- **Parallelization**: Sei’s architecture emphasizes parallel execution and throughput. PoS provides the underlying consensus security while Sei processes transactions efficiently at the execution layer.
- **EVM compatibility**: Developers can deploy Solidity smart contracts on Sei’s EVM environment while relying on PoS-backed consensus and fast finality for transaction assurance.

### Checking validator and staking information (example)

You can inspect staking state and validators using Sei’s CLI (command names may vary depending on your installation and network):

```bash
# List validators
seid query staking validators

# Check a specific validator by operator address
seid query staking validator <valoper_address>

# View staking parameters (unbonding time, etc.)
seid query staking params
```

### Delegation flow (conceptual)

Delegation typically follows:

1. Choose a validator (review uptime, commission, and voting power distribution).
2. Delegate tokens to contribute to their stake.
3. Earn rewards proportional to delegated stake (subject to commission).
4. Accept that penalties (like slashing) can impact delegated stake if the validator misbehaves.

```bash
# Delegate tokens to a validator
seid tx staking delegate <valoper_address> 1000000usei \
  --from <your_key> --chain-id <chain_id> --gas auto --gas-adjustment 1.3
```

## Summary

Proof of Stake secures a blockchain by requiring validators to lock up capital, rewarding honest participation, and penalizing provable misbehavior—making attacks expensive and self-defeating. On Sei Network, PoS underpins a fast-finality, high-throughput chain, supporting parallelized execution and EVM-compatible smart contracts with strong economic and cryptographic security guarantees.
