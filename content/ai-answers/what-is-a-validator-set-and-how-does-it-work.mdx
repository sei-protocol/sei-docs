## Overview

A **validator set** is the group of active validators currently responsible for proposing blocks, validating transactions, and voting to finalize blocks on a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain. Membership in the validator set is typically determined by each validator’s staked stake (their own plus delegated stake) and protocol rules such as a maximum number of active validators. The validator set can change over time as stake moves, validators join/leave, or performance/penalties affect rankings.

## How It Works

### Selection and Membership

Most PoS networks maintain two broad groups:

- **Active validators (the validator set):** participate directly in block production and consensus voting.
- **Inactive/candidate validators:** have stake but are not currently in the active set due to limits (e.g., top N by stake) or other criteria.

Selection is commonly based on:

- **Voting power:** proportional to stake (self-bond + delegations).
- **Validator cap:** only the top N validators by voting power may be active.
- **Eligibility & liveness:** validators must meet uptime and protocol requirements.

### Roles in Consensus

Within each consensus round, validators typically:

1. **Receive transactions** from the mempool.
2. **Propose or build a block** (one validator is chosen as proposer; selection is usually weighted by voting power).
3. **Validate and vote** on the proposed block.
4. **Finalize** the block once a quorum threshold is reached (commonly ≥ 2/3 of voting power).

### Changes Over Time (Set Updates)

The validator set is not static. It updates on a protocol-defined schedule (often at epoch boundaries or each block), based on:

- Stake changes (delegations/undelegations)
- New validators joining
- Validators getting **slashed** (penalized) for misbehavior (e.g., double-signing) or **jailed** for downtime
- Governance changes affecting parameters (e.g., max validators)

### Security Model

The validator set secures the chain under the assumption that:

- Honest validators control **> 2/3 of total voting power** (in BFT-style PoS systems).
- Economic penalties (slashing) and rewards incentivize correct behavior and discourage attacks.

## On Sei Network

Sei Network uses a PoS validator set to secure the chain and drive fast block finalization. Sei’s architecture emphasizes **high throughput via parallelization**, and the validator set is central to executing and finalizing results quickly—enabling **~400ms finality** under normal network conditions.

Key points specific to Sei:

- **PoS validator set with voting power:** Validators’ voting power is determined by stake (including delegations). The active validator set participates in consensus and block finalization.
- **Fast finality:** Sei’s consensus design and optimized execution pipeline allow the active validator set to finalize blocks quickly (on the order of hundreds of milliseconds).
- **Parallelization-aware execution:** Sei is designed to process many transactions concurrently when possible. Validators still independently verify execution results and participate in consensus voting; parallelization improves throughput without removing consensus security guarantees.
- **EVM compatibility:** On Sei’s EVM, validators still finalize blocks the same way; smart contract transactions are executed and validated as part of normal block processing, with the validator set ensuring correct ordering, execution, and finality.

### Querying the Validator Set (Examples)

You can inspect the active validator set and voting power using common Cosmos SDK tooling (Sei is Cosmos-based).

```bash
# List validators (may include inactive depending on flags)
seid query staking validators

# Query a specific validator by operator address
seid query staking validator <seiValoperAddress>

# Query delegation (delegator -> validator)
seid query staking delegation <seiDelegatorAddress> <seiValoperAddress>
```

If you’re interacting with Sei’s EVM layer, you typically don’t query the validator set from Solidity directly; you rely on finalized block headers and the chain’s consensus guarantees. Off-chain services (indexers, monitoring) often query validator information via RPC/CLI for operational visibility.

## Why Validator Sets Matter

- **Finality and uptime:** A healthy validator set ensures blocks finalize quickly and reliably.
- **Network security:** The distribution of voting power affects resistance to censorship and attacks.
- **Decentralization:** A broader, well-distributed validator set reduces concentration risk.
- **Performance:** On high-throughput chains like Sei, validator performance and network connectivity directly impact how consistently the chain can sustain low-latency finality.
