## Overview

A smart contract is a self-executing program deployed on a blockchain that automatically enforces rules and actions when predefined conditions are met. Instead of relying on a centralized intermediary, the contract’s code and state live on-chain, making execution transparent, verifiable, and resistant to tampering.

## How It Works

### 1) Code + State on a Blockchain

A smart contract consists of:

- **Code**: the logic (functions, conditions, access controls).
- **State**: stored data (balances, ownership records, configuration).
- **Events/Logs**: emitted records that off-chain apps can index and display.

Once deployed, the contract is addressed on-chain and can be called by users, wallets, or other contracts.

### 2) Transactions Trigger Execution

Smart contracts don’t “run” on their own; they execute when a transaction calls a function:

- A user signs a transaction to call `contract.someFunction(args)`.
- Validators execute the function, updating state if rules pass.
- The result is recorded in the next block (or included in consensus for finality).

### 3) Deterministic Execution and Consensus

All nodes/validators independently run the same contract call and must arrive at the **same result** (determinism). Consensus ensures only one canonical outcome is accepted, so contract state remains consistent across the network.

### 4) Gas/Fees and Resource Limits

On EVM-compatible chains, execution costs **gas**, which prevents spam and pays for compute/storage. If the transaction runs out of gas or hits a failing condition (e.g., `require(false)`), it **reverts**, undoing state changes for that call.

### 5) Typical Use Cases

Smart contracts power many on-chain applications, including:

- Token issuance (ERC-20 style tokens)
- NFTs (ERC-721 / ERC-1155)
- DEXs and AMMs
- Lending/borrowing protocols
- On-chain governance and DAOs
- Escrow, auctions, and automated settlement

## On Sei Network

Sei is a high-performance Layer 1 with **EVM compatibility**, enabling developers to deploy and run Solidity smart contracts with familiar tooling. Sei’s architecture emphasizes **parallelization** (processing many independent transactions concurrently when possible) and provides **~400ms finality**, which can significantly improve the user experience for contract-driven apps like trading, payments, and real-time games.

Key implications for smart contracts on Sei:

- **EVM compatibility**: Write contracts in Solidity and interact using standard Ethereum-style tools and APIs.
- **Fast finality (~400ms)**: Contract state changes become final quickly, reducing “waiting time” after a transaction.
- **Parallelization**: Independent contract calls can be executed more efficiently, improving throughput for high-activity apps.

## Example: A Simple Solidity Smart Contract

Below is a minimal counter contract that stores state and emits an event when updated:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

contract Counter {
    uint256 public value;

    event Incremented(uint256 newValue);

    function increment() external {
        value += 1;
        emit Incremented(value);
    }
}
```

**What happens when `increment()` is called:**

1. A user submits a transaction calling `increment()`.
2. The Sei EVM executes the function deterministically.
3. `value` updates in contract state and `Incremented` is logged.
4. The transaction is finalized (typically ~400ms on Sei).

## Deploying and Calling (EVM Tooling Example)

Using Foundry is a common approach for EVM chains (RPC URL and chain ID depend on your Sei environment):

```bash
# Deploy
forge create \
  --rpc-url $SEI_EVM_RPC_URL \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
  src/Counter.sol:Counter

# Call a view function (read state)
cast call <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "value()(uint256)" --rpc-url $SEI_EVM_RPC_URL

# Send a transaction (write state)
cast send <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "increment()" \
  --rpc-url $SEI_EVM_RPC_URL \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```

## Common Smart Contract Properties and Risks

- **Immutability**: Deployed code is typically permanent; upgrades require explicit patterns (e.g., proxies) and careful governance.
- **Transparency**: Logic and state are publicly verifiable (unless using specialized privacy tech).
- **Security**: Bugs can be exploited; common issues include reentrancy, access-control mistakes, unsafe external calls, and integer/logic errors.
- **Audits and testing**: Thorough testing, code reviews, audits, and monitoring are standard best practices.

## Summary

Smart contracts are on-chain programs that execute deterministically when triggered by transactions, enabling trust-minimized automation without centralized intermediaries. On Sei Network, developers can deploy Solidity contracts via EVM compatibility while benefiting from parallelized execution and ~400ms finality—features that help smart contract applications feel fast and responsive under load.
