## Overview

Block time is the average interval between two consecutive blocks being produced and added to a blockchain. It’s a core performance characteristic because it influences how quickly transactions are included in a block and how responsive the network feels to users. Block time is related to—but distinct from—**finality**, which is when a transaction is considered irreversible.

## How It Works

### Block production and block time

Most blockchains group pending transactions from the mempool into blocks. A designated block producer (depending on the consensus mechanism) proposes the next block, the network validates it, and then it’s appended to the chain. **Block time** is the cadence of this process.

- **Shorter block time** generally means faster inclusion of transactions and a more “real-time” experience.
- **Longer block time** can reduce network overhead but may increase the time users wait for inclusion.

### Consensus affects block time

Block time is shaped by the chain’s consensus design:

- **Proof of Work (PoW):** Block time is influenced by mining difficulty and hash power (e.g., targeting a set average).
- **Proof of Stake (PoS) / BFT-style protocols:** Block time is influenced by validator rounds, leader selection, and network latency.

Many PoS chains operate in “slots” or “rounds” where a validator is selected to propose a block. If a proposer fails or the network is congested, a slot can be missed or blocks can be delayed—so block time is often expressed as an _average_ rather than a guaranteed constant.

### Block time vs. confirmation time vs. finality

These terms are often conflated:

- **Block time:** How frequently blocks are produced.
- **Confirmation time:** How long until your transaction appears in a block (can be less than or greater than the average block time depending on congestion and fees).
- **Finality:** How long until the network considers the block/transaction irreversible (may require multiple blocks on probabilistic-finality systems, or a single finalized commit on deterministic-finality systems).

### Practical impacts

Block time affects:

- **User experience:** Faster dApps, quicker swaps, snappier interactions.
- **MEV dynamics:** Shorter block intervals can change auction/ordering dynamics.
- **Throughput vs. overhead trade-offs:** More frequent blocks can increase bandwidth and validation overhead.
- **Fee market behavior:** Congestion can cause transaction inclusion delays even on fast block-time networks.

## On Sei Network

Sei is a high-performance Layer 1 designed for low-latency trading and high-throughput applications. While block time describes the pace of block production, Sei is especially notable for its **fast finality (~400ms)**, enabling transactions to become final quickly in practice.

Key implications on Sei:

- **Near-instant user feedback:** With ~400ms finality, many interactions feel close to real time once included.
- **High throughput via parallelization:** Sei’s parallelization enables the chain to execute many transactions concurrently when they don’t conflict, which helps maintain responsiveness under load.
- **EVM compatibility:** Developers can deploy Solidity smart contracts and build EVM-based dApps while benefiting from Sei’s performance characteristics.

### Measuring block timing and finality (examples)

#### Query the latest block (Sei EVM / JSON-RPC)

```bash
curl -s -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getBlockByNumber","params":["latest",false],"id":1}' \
  https://<sei-evm-rpc>
```

#### Estimate time between recent blocks (TypeScript)

```typescript
import { JsonRpcProvider } from 'ethers';

const provider = new JsonRpcProvider('https://<sei-evm-rpc>');

async function estimateBlockTime(sample = 20) {
  const latest = await provider.getBlockNumber();
  const newest = await provider.getBlock(latest);
  const older = await provider.getBlock(latest - sample);

  // timestamps are in seconds
  const deltaSeconds = newest.timestamp - older.timestamp;
  return deltaSeconds / sample;
}

estimateBlockTime().then((bt) => {
  console.log(`Estimated average block time: ${bt.toFixed(2)}s`);
});
```

#### Wait for transaction confirmation (Solidity context via client)

On EVM networks (including Sei EVM), applications commonly wait for a transaction receipt and optionally additional confirmations:

```typescript
const tx = await contract.doSomething();
const receipt = await tx.wait(1); // wait for 1 confirmation (1 block)
console.log('Included in block:', receipt.blockNumber);
```

> Note: Because **finality** and **block production** are different, “1 confirmation” indicates inclusion in a block; finality depends on the chain’s finality guarantees and consensus behavior. On Sei, finality is designed to be fast, which benefits user experience and application responsiveness.

## Summary

Block time is the average interval at which a blockchain produces new blocks, impacting how quickly transactions are included and how responsive applications feel. It’s distinct from finality, which determines when transactions become irreversible. On Sei, developers benefit not only from efficient block production but also from **~400ms finality**, **parallelized execution**, and **EVM compatibility**, enabling fast, scalable on-chain applications.
