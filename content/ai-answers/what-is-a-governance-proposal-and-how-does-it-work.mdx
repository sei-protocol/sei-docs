## Overview

A governance proposal is a formal, on-chain request to change or manage a blockchain network—such as upgrading the protocol, adjusting parameters, allocating community funds, or coordinating other decisions. It turns community intent into an auditable process where token holders can vote, and (depending on the system) approved changes can be executed automatically or by coordinated operators.

## How It Works

Governance designs vary by chain, but most on-chain proposal systems follow a similar lifecycle:

1. **Creation (Draft → On-chain Proposal)**

   - A proposer submits a proposal describing the change (e.g., “increase max block gas” or “fund a grants program”).
   - Many networks require a **deposit** (or fee) to discourage spam and ensure the proposer has some stake.

2. **Deposit / Qualification Period (Optional)**

   - Some systems require the proposal to reach a minimum deposit threshold before it becomes an active voting item.
   - If the threshold isn’t met by the deadline, the proposal fails and deposits may be partially or fully refunded/burned depending on the rules.

3. **Voting Period**

   - Token holders (or delegated validators) cast votes, typically `Yes`, `No`, `NoWithVeto`, and `Abstain`.
   - Votes are weighted by stake (direct holdings or delegated voting power).

4. **Tallying & Rules**
   Governance outcomes are usually determined by:

   - **Quorum**: minimum participation required (e.g., at least X% of voting power voted).
   - **Threshold**: minimum “Yes” share needed to pass.
   - **Veto**: if “NoWithVeto” exceeds a set threshold, the proposal can fail decisively and deposits may be penalized.

5. **Execution**
   - **Parameter changes** can be applied automatically if the governance module supports it.
   - **Software upgrades** may require validators/operators to coordinate an upgrade at a specified block height/time.
   - **Treasury spend** (if supported) executes payouts from a community pool under defined conditions.

### Common Proposal Types

- **Parameter Change**: Modify protocol settings (fees, limits, slashing, etc.).
- **Software Upgrade**: Move the chain to a new binary/version.
- **Treasury / Community Pool Spend**: Allocate funds to grants, contributors, or initiatives.
- **Text / Signaling**: Non-binding decisions used to gauge community sentiment.

## On Sei Network

Sei Network supports on-chain governance to coordinate protocol evolution while maintaining high performance. Approved decisions—such as parameter adjustments or planned upgrades—can be enacted transparently, with results finalized quickly thanks to Sei’s fast consensus and ~400ms block finality.

Key points for Sei governance:

- **Stake-weighted voting**: Voting power is generally based on staked tokens, often with delegation to validators (depending on the governance configuration).
- **Rapid confirmation**: Proposal transactions and votes are recorded and finalized quickly, benefiting from Sei’s low-latency finality.
- **Performance-aware upgrades**: Governance can be used to introduce improvements that preserve Sei’s throughput and parallelization-focused architecture.
- **EVM compatibility considerations**: When proposals relate to EVM behavior (e.g., gas settings, opcode/config changes, or system contract upgrades), governance provides a transparent path for coordinating network-wide changes that affect EVM developers and users.

## Example: Submitting and Voting via CLI

Below is an illustrative example of how governance interactions commonly look on Cosmos-SDK–style chains (Sei uses Cosmos tooling). Exact commands, flags, and proposal formats can vary by Sei version and governance module configuration, so always reference the current Sei docs and chain parameters.

```bash
# Check current governance parameters
seid q gov params

# List active proposals
seid q gov proposals --status voting_period

# Vote on a proposal (options often include yes/no/abstain/no_with_veto)
seid tx gov vote <proposal_id> yes \
  --from <your_key_name> \
  --gas auto --gas-adjustment 1.3 --fees 2000usei
```

## Example: Monitoring a Proposal (TypeScript)

You can also monitor proposal state using an RPC/REST client. The exact endpoint depends on your stack, but the flow is generally:

1. fetch proposals, 2) filter by status, 3) fetch tally/votes.

```typescript
import fetch from 'node-fetch';

const LCD = process.env.LCD_URL ?? 'https://lcd.sei.example.com';

async function getVotingProposals() {
  const res = await fetch(`${LCD}/cosmos/gov/v1/proposals?proposal_status=PROPOSAL_STATUS_VOTING_PERIOD`);
  if (!res.ok) throw new Error(`LCD error: ${res.status}`);
  const data = await res.json();
  return data.proposals ?? [];
}

(async () => {
  const proposals = await getVotingProposals();
  for (const p of proposals) {
    console.log(`#${p.id}: ${p.metadata?.title ?? p.title} (status: ${p.status})`);
  }
})();
```

## Practical Tips

- **Read the full proposal**: Look for scope, risks, migration plan, and upgrade height (if applicable).
- **Watch for quorum and deadlines**: A good proposal can still fail if participation is low.
- **Understand execution**: Passing a proposal may trigger automatic state changes, or it may require coordinated validator action for upgrades.
- **For builders**: If your dApp relies on specific EVM or fee assumptions, track governance proposals that might change those parameters and test against proposed upgrades early.
