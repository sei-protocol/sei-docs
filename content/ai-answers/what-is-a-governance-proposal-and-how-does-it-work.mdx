# What is a Governance Proposal and How Does It Work?

## Overview

A **governance proposal** is a formal on-chain request to change how a blockchain network operates—such as upgrading software, adjusting parameters, spending community funds, or managing access/permissions. In short, **what is governance proposal** usually refers to the mechanism token holders (or their delegates) use to coordinate changes transparently, with rules enforced by the blockchain itself.

## How It Works

Most blockchain governance systems follow a common lifecycle:

### 1) Proposal Creation

A proposer drafts a proposal with:

- A **title/summary** and detailed description
- The **type** of change (e.g., parameter change, software upgrade, community spend)
- Any required **payload** (e.g., new parameter values, upgrade height, recipient addresses)
- A **deposit** (in many PoS systems) to prevent spam and ensure seriousness

If the proposal meets minimum requirements (including deposit thresholds), it enters an official voting period.

### 2) Voting Period

Eligible voters (often token holders) can vote directly or via **delegation** to validators or representatives. Common vote options include:

- **Yes**
- **No**
- **NoWithVeto** (signals the proposal is harmful/spam; may slash deposit depending on chain rules)
- **Abstain**

Governance rules typically define:

- **Quorum**: minimum participation required
- **Threshold**: minimum “Yes” ratio to pass
- **Veto**: maximum allowed “NoWithVeto” before automatically failing

### 3) Tallying & Outcome

At the end of voting, the chain tallies votes according to its rules. If the proposal passes, it moves to execution.

### 4) Execution / Enactment

Execution depends on proposal type:

- **Parameter changes** may be applied automatically.
- **Community spend** may transfer funds from a community pool.
- **Software upgrades** may schedule an upgrade height/time (validators coordinate to run the new binary).
- Some systems require off-chain steps (e.g., validators upgrading nodes) even if the decision is on-chain.

## Common Types of Governance Proposals

- **Protocol upgrades**: adopt new consensus or application logic
- **Parameter changes**: adjust fees, staking params, gas settings, limits
- **Treasury/community spend**: fund development, grants, ecosystem initiatives
- **Text proposals** (in some ecosystems): signaling/community coordination without automatic execution
- **Permissioning/whitelisting** (chain-dependent): manage access to specific modules or features

## Why Governance Proposals Matter

Governance proposals provide a structured way to:

- Evolve protocol rules without centralized control
- Increase transparency (all votes and outcomes are auditable)
- Align incentives between validators, token holders, builders, and users
- Reduce forks by giving stakeholders a standard decision process

## On Sei Network

Sei Network uses on-chain governance to coordinate upgrades and parameter changes in a way that matches Sei’s design goals: **high throughput, parallelized execution, and fast finality (~400ms)**. Once a governance proposal is submitted and enters voting, stakeholders can vote on-chain; when it passes, the network can enact changes in a predictable, transparent manner.

Key ways governance proposals relate to Sei:

- **Fast finality improves governance UX**: transactions for voting and proposal interactions confirm quickly, making participation more responsive during active voting windows.
- **Parallelization supports scale**: as network usage grows, Sei’s parallelized execution helps governance interactions (proposal submissions, vote transactions) remain efficient alongside normal app traffic.
- **EVM compatibility**: Sei’s EVM support enables governance-related tooling and integrations familiar to Ethereum developers (e.g., indexers, analytics, wallets), while core chain governance remains on-chain and auditable.

> Note: The exact governance parameters (deposit amount, quorum, thresholds, voting period) are chain-configurable and may change over time via governance itself.

## Practical Examples

### Check proposals and vote via CLI (Cosmos SDK-style)

If you’re using Sei’s CLI tooling, governance flows typically look like:

```bash
# List proposals
seid query gov proposals

# Get details for a specific proposal
seid query gov proposal <proposal-id>

# Vote on a proposal (example: "yes")
seid tx gov vote <proposal-id> yes \
  --from <your-key> \
  --chain-id <sei-chain-id> \
  --fees <fee-amount><denom>
```

### Query governance state from an app (TypeScript example)

Many apps query governance via RPC/REST endpoints exposed by full nodes (exact endpoints depend on your stack and provider). Conceptually:

```typescript
// Pseudocode: fetch proposal details from a REST endpoint
const proposalId = 42;
const res = await fetch(`https://<rest-endpoint>/cosmos/gov/v1/proposals/${proposalId}`);
const proposal = await res.json();

console.log(proposal);
```

## Summary

A governance proposal is the on-chain process for proposing, voting on, and enacting changes to a blockchain network. In general, it moves through creation, voting, tallying, and execution under predefined rules like quorum and thresholds. On Sei Network, governance proposals benefit from Sei’s fast finality and scalable, parallelized design—supporting efficient participation and reliable network evolution as the ecosystem grows.
