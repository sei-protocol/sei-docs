## Overview

A custodial wallet is a crypto wallet where a third party (such as an exchange or wallet provider) holds and manages your private keys on your behalf. You access and control funds through an account (login, app, or API), but the custodian ultimately controls the signing authority for transactions. This model prioritizes convenience and account recovery, but requires trusting the custodian’s security and policies.

## How It Works

### Key management and transaction signing

In blockchain systems, ownership and spending power are determined by **private keys**. In a custodial wallet:

- The **custodian generates and stores** the private keys (often using secure infrastructure like HSMs or multisig setups).
- When you initiate a transfer in the app, you’re typically creating a **request** (amount, destination, chain).
- The custodian validates the request (security checks, AML/KYC limits, withdrawal rules).
- The custodian **signs the transaction** with the private key and broadcasts it to the network.
- The blockchain confirms the transaction; your custodian updates your displayed balance.

### Account-based UX and internal ledgers

Many custodians maintain an **internal ledger**:

- Transfers between users of the same platform may be “off-chain” (internal bookkeeping).
- On-chain transactions occur when depositing to or withdrawing from the platform.

### Recovery, security, and trade-offs

Common properties of custodial wallets:

- **Pros**: password-based access, customer support, account recovery, simpler UX, integrated fiat on/off ramps.
- **Cons**: counterparty risk (custodian failure, insolvency), withdrawal restrictions, potential censorship, privacy trade-offs, and you don’t directly control private keys.

### Custodial vs. non-custodial (quick contrast)

- **Custodial**: “Not your keys, not your coins.” The provider signs transactions.
- **Non-custodial**: You hold the keys (seed phrase/private key) and sign locally.

## On Sei Network

Custodial wallets on Sei work the same way conceptually: the custodian holds the keys for Sei addresses and signs transactions that interact with Sei’s chain. Sei’s architecture and features influence how custodial experiences feel in practice:

- **Fast finality (~400ms)**: Withdrawals and on-chain actions can confirm quickly once the custodian broadcasts a transaction, improving perceived settlement speed.
- **Parallelization**: Sei’s parallel execution model can improve throughput and reduce contention for many transactions, which is valuable for custodians handling high-volume withdrawals, deposits, and contract interactions.
- **EVM compatibility**: Custodians can support Sei similarly to other EVM chains—managing Ethereum-style accounts/keys and signing EVM transactions—while benefiting from Sei’s performance characteristics.

### Typical custodial flow on Sei

1. User requests a withdrawal to a Sei address (or an EVM-compatible address format, depending on the integration).
2. Custodian’s risk engine checks limits and compliance rules.
3. Custodian signs and broadcasts the transaction on Sei.
4. Transaction reaches finality quickly; custodian updates the user’s balance and withdrawal status.

## Example: Sending a Sei EVM Transaction (Custodian-Style)

In many custodial implementations, signing happens on backend infrastructure. The following example demonstrates a backend service signing and sending an EVM transaction to Sei using a private key (for illustration—real custodians typically use HSMs, MPC, or multisig rather than raw keys in environment variables).

```typescript
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

const RPC_URL = process.env.SEI_EVM_RPC_URL!; // Sei EVM RPC endpoint
const PRIVATE_KEY = process.env.CUSTODIAN_SIGNER_KEY!; // managed securely in production

async function sendWithdrawal(to: string, amountEth: string) {
  const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(RPC_URL);
  const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(PRIVATE_KEY, provider);

  const tx = await wallet.sendTransaction({
    to,
    value: ethers.parseEther(amountEth)
  });

  console.log('Broadcasted tx:', tx.hash);
  const receipt = await tx.wait();
  console.log('Confirmed in block:', receipt?.blockNumber);
}

sendWithdrawal('0xRecipientAddressHere', '0.01').catch(console.error);
```

## When to Use a Custodial Wallet

Custodial wallets are often a good fit when:

- You want the simplest onboarding (email/password, no seed phrase handling).
- You need integrated services (fiat ramps, trading, compliance workflows).
- You prioritize recoverability and support over self-custody.

They are less ideal when:

- You need full sovereign control of funds and keys.
- You want censorship resistance and permissionless access at all times.
- You’re managing large balances without counterparty exposure.

## Key Takeaways

- A custodial wallet delegates private key control to a trusted third party.
- The custodian signs transactions and may use internal ledgers for user balances.
- On Sei, custodial wallets can provide fast, responsive on-chain settlement, aided by ~400ms finality, parallelization, and EVM compatibility.
