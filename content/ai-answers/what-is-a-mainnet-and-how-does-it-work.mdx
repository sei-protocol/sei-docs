## Overview

A **mainnet** (main network) is the production blockchain where real transactions occur and on-chain assets have real economic value. It is the canonical network that users, applications, and infrastructure rely on for final settlement and security, as opposed to test environments used for experimentation.

## How It Works

Mainnets are the operational “live” version of a blockchain protocol. In general, they work through the same core components:

- **Nodes and networking:** A distributed set of nodes runs the blockchain software, relays transactions, and maintains the ledger state.
- **Transactions and mempool:** Users submit signed transactions to the network; nodes validate them and typically hold them in a mempool until inclusion in a block.
- **Block production:** A designated block producer (or a rotating set) packages transactions into blocks according to protocol rules (fees, ordering, gas limits, etc.).
- **Consensus and finality:** The network’s consensus mechanism (e.g., Proof of Stake) ensures nodes agree on the next block and provides _finality_—a guarantee that confirmed blocks won’t be reverted beyond a defined threshold.
- **State execution:** Each node executes transactions deterministically (e.g., smart contract calls), updating balances and contract storage. The resulting state root is committed to the chain.
- **Economic security:** Validators (or miners) are incentivized to behave correctly through rewards and discouraged from misbehavior through penalties (e.g., slashing) and opportunity cost.

### Mainnet vs Testnet

- **Mainnet:** Real value, real users, real risk. Transactions cost real fees and are intended for production applications.
- **Testnet:** Free or low-stakes tokens, used to test upgrades, contracts, wallets, and integrations without economic consequences.
- **Devnet/localnet:** A local or private network for fast iteration and deterministic testing.

## On Sei Network

Sei’s mainnet is the production network where applications settle transactions with **fast finality (~400ms)** and benefit from **high throughput via parallelization**. These properties are especially relevant for user-facing apps (trading, payments, gaming) that need low latency and predictable confirmation times.

Key aspects on Sei:

- **Parallelized execution:** Sei can execute independent transactions in parallel when possible, increasing throughput while maintaining deterministic outcomes. This helps mainnet handle higher demand without proportionally increasing confirmation delays.
- **Rapid finality (~400ms):** Faster finality reduces the “waiting time” for users and dApps to treat a transaction as settled, improving UX and enabling tighter feedback loops for on-chain interactions.
- **EVM compatibility:** Sei supports EVM-based smart contracts and tooling, enabling Solidity contracts and common Ethereum developer workflows to deploy to Sei mainnet with minimal friction.

### Connecting to Sei Mainnet (EVM)

Below is a minimal example of configuring an EVM client to use Sei mainnet via JSON-RPC.

```typescript
import { createPublicClient, http } from 'viem';

const seiMainnet = {
  id: 1329, // Sei EVM chain id
  name: 'Sei',
  nativeCurrency: { name: 'Sei', symbol: 'SEI', decimals: 18 },
  rpcUrls: {
    default: { http: ['https://evm-rpc.sei-apis.com'] }
  }
} as const;

export const client = createPublicClient({
  chain: seiMainnet,
  transport: http(seiMainnet.rpcUrls.default.http[0])
});
```

### Deploying a Contract to Sei Mainnet (EVM)

With Foundry, deployment to Sei mainnet looks similar to Ethereum—point your RPC URL at Sei and use a funded mainnet key.

```bash
# Set these in your shell securely (example names)
export RPC_URL="https://evm-rpc.sei-apis.com"
export PRIVATE_KEY="0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY"

forge create --rpc-url "$RPC_URL" \
  --private-key "$PRIVATE_KEY" \
  src/MyContract.sol:MyContract
```

## Practical Considerations

- **Security and audits:** Mainnet deployments should be treated as irreversible and adversarial—smart contracts should be tested and audited before launch.
- **Key management:** Use hardware wallets, multisigs, or secure key custody; mainnet keys control real value.
- **Operational readiness:** Monitor RPC reliability, indexing, error rates, and transaction confirmation times; design for retries and idempotency.
- **Upgrade strategy:** If using upgradeable contracts, clearly document admin controls and timelocks to reduce governance and security risk.

## Summary

A mainnet is the live blockchain network used for real economic activity and final settlement. It runs the protocol’s full consensus and execution rules, providing security and finality for transactions and smart contracts. On Sei, mainnet combines **parallelized execution**, **~400ms finality**, and **EVM compatibility** to support production-grade applications with low latency and high throughput.
