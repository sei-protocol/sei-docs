## Overview

Staking rewards are incentives paid to participants who lock up (stake) tokens to help secure a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain and keep it operating correctly. In return for contributing economic security and participating in consensus, stakers earn periodic rewards, typically paid in the network’s native token.

## How It Works

### Staking in Proof-of-Stake Networks

In PoS systems, validators are selected (often probabilistically, weighted by stake) to propose and attest to new blocks. Staking aligns incentives: validators and their delegators earn rewards for honest participation and can be penalized for misbehavior.

### Who Earns Rewards

- **Validators**: Run infrastructure (nodes) that participate directly in consensus.
- **Delegators**: Stake tokens by delegating to a validator, sharing in rewards without running a node.

Most PoS chains use a _bonded stake_ model:

1. You **bond** (stake) tokens to a validator.
2. The validator participates in block production and voting.
3. Rewards are minted (or sourced from fees) and distributed to the validator and delegators.
4. If you want to exit, you **unbond** (unstake), often subject to an unbonding period.

### Where Rewards Come From

Staking rewards commonly come from:

- **Protocol inflation** (newly minted tokens) to incentivize security.
- **Transaction fees** (a portion of fees paid by users).
- **MEV or additional protocol revenues** (chain-dependent).

### How Rewards Are Calculated

While exact formulas vary by chain, typical factors include:

- **Total staked supply**: Higher total stake can reduce per-token yield (and vice versa).
- **Validator commission**: Validators charge a percentage of rewards for operating services.
- **Validator performance**: Uptime, correct voting, and participation affect payouts.
- **Slashing risk**: Downtime or malicious behavior can result in penalties that reduce stake.

> Important: APY/APR figures are variable and depend on network conditions (inflation, fees, total stake) and validator commission/performance.

### Risks and Tradeoffs

- **Slashing**: Loss of a portion of stake for protocol violations (e.g., double-signing, extended downtime).
- **Unbonding period**: Funds may be illiquid while unbonding.
- **Smart contract risk** (if using liquid staking or DeFi strategies): Additional layers may introduce security risk.
- **Opportunity cost**: Staked assets may not be immediately usable elsewhere unless liquid staking is used.

## On Sei Network

Sei is a high-performance Layer 1 designed for fast finality and parallel execution, and it supports **EVM compatibility**—meaning you can build and use Ethereum-style smart contracts while benefiting from Sei’s performance characteristics.

### Rewards on Sei (Validator + Delegator Model)

Sei uses a PoS validator set where:

- **Validators** secure the chain and propose/validate blocks.
- **Delegators** stake by delegating SEI to validators to earn a share of rewards.

Rewards distribution typically follows:

1. You delegate SEI to a chosen validator.
2. The validator earns rewards for participating in consensus.
3. The validator takes a **commission**.
4. Remaining rewards are distributed proportionally to delegators.

Because Sei targets **~400ms finality** and is engineered for high throughput with **parallelization**, the network can confirm transactions quickly, supporting responsive staking UX and rapid on-chain activity (while staking itself still follows protocol-defined bonding/unbonding rules).

### EVM Compatibility and Staking-Adjacent Use Cases

Sei’s EVM support enables:

- **Wallets and dapps** to integrate staking-related flows (e.g., dashboards, analytics).
- **Smart contracts** to interact with staking-adjacent primitives (depending on the app design), such as routing rewards into DeFi strategies or building liquid staking experiences (when available).

## Example: Checking Validator Info and Delegating (CLI)

Below are representative commands using a Cosmos SDK-style CLI (exact binary/flags may differ depending on your environment and version):

```bash
# View the validator set
seid query staking validators

# View a specific validator by operator address
seid query staking validator <validator-operator-address>

# Delegate 1000000usei (adjust denom/amount as appropriate)
seid tx staking delegate <validator-operator-address> 1000000usei \
  --from <your-key> \
  --chain-id <sei-chain-id> \
  --gas auto --gas-adjustment 1.3 \
  --fees <fee-amount><fee-denom>
```

To track your delegations and rewards:

```bash
# View your delegations
seid query staking delegations <your-account-address>

# View your distribution rewards
seid query distribution rewards <your-account-address>
```

## Practical Tips

- **Compare validator commission and performance**: Lower commission isn’t always better if uptime is poor.
- **Diversify delegations**: Spreading stake across multiple validators can reduce operational risk.
- **Understand unbonding/withdrawal mechanics**: Plan for liquidity needs and any protocol-defined waiting periods.
- **Monitor slashing conditions**: Choose reputable validators with good operational practices.

## Summary

Staking rewards compensate validators and delegators for securing a PoS blockchain and keeping consensus running smoothly. They’re typically funded by inflation and/or transaction fees and are influenced by total stake, validator commission, and performance. On Sei Network, staking follows the validator/delegator model while benefiting from Sei’s high-throughput design, parallel execution, and fast (~400ms) finality, alongside EVM compatibility for modern wallet and dapp integrations.
