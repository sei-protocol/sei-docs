## Overview

A **DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)** is an on-chain organization whose rules, treasury, and decision-making are enforced by smart contracts rather than a centralized management team. Members coordinate through transparent governance processes—typically proposals and token-weighted or membership-based voting—so actions can be executed programmatically once approved.

## How It Works

### 1) Smart contracts define the rules

A DAO’s core logic lives in smart contracts that specify:

- **Membership** (e.g., governance token holders, NFT holders, allowlisted addresses)
- **Voting mechanics** (quorum, thresholds, voting period, vote weighting)
- **Proposal lifecycle** (creation, voting, queueing, execution, cancellation)
- **Treasury controls** (how funds can be spent and who can trigger transfers)

Because the contracts are on-chain, anyone can inspect the rules and the history of decisions.

### 2) Proposals coordinate decisions

A typical flow:

1. A member creates a **proposal** (e.g., fund a grant, upgrade a contract, change parameters).
2. Members **vote** during a defined voting window.
3. If the proposal passes, it becomes **executable**—often after a timelock or delay.
4. The DAO **executes** the action on-chain (e.g., sending funds, calling an upgrade function).

### 3) Governance power is determined by a mechanism

Common models include:

- **Token-weighted voting**: 1 token = 1 vote (or delegated voting).
- **NFT / membership voting**: 1 member = 1 vote (or role-based voting).
- **Multisig governance**: a set of signers collectively approves actions (often used early-stage).

### 4) Treasury management is on-chain

DAOs frequently manage a shared treasury (ETH, ERC-20s, NFTs, and other assets). Execution typically occurs through:

- **Direct contract calls** from a governance executor
- **Timelocks** that delay execution to allow review
- **Spending permissions** for committees or smaller working groups

### 5) Security and operational considerations

Key risks and best practices:

- **Smart contract risk** (bugs, upgrade misconfigurations) → audits, formal verification, conservative upgrade paths
- **Governance attacks** (vote buying, flash-loan voting if not prevented) → snapshots, token locks, quorum/threshold tuning
- **Operational complexity** → clear proposal templates, delegation, documentation, and monitoring

## On Sei Network

Sei’s high-performance Layer 1 design makes governance-heavy applications practical at scale:

- **Fast finality (~400ms)**: Voting, proposal execution, and treasury actions can finalize quickly, improving governance responsiveness and reducing “waiting time” between decision and execution.
- **Parallelization**: Sei’s execution model can process many independent transactions concurrently, helping DAOs handle high participation (many voters, many proposals, frequent treasury ops) without becoming a bottleneck.
- **EVM compatibility**: DAOs built with standard Solidity tooling and widely used governance patterns can deploy on Sei’s EVM, enabling familiar frameworks and contract architectures.

### Common DAO patterns you can deploy on Sei

- **Token-governed treasuries** (grants, ecosystem funds, protocol revenue management)
- **Protocol parameter governance** (fee switches, whitelists, risk parameters)
- **On-chain committees** (role-based spending caps, operational multisigs with on-chain accountability)
- **Upgradeable protocol governance** (managed upgrades with timelocks and transparent execution)

## Code Examples

### Example: Minimal on-chain DAO (Solidity)

This is a simplified illustration of proposals, voting, and execution using token-weighted voting. In production, use audited libraries (e.g., OpenZeppelin Governor) and robust security controls (timelocks, snapshots, etc.).

```solidity

pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

interface IERC20VotesLike {
    function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256);
}

contract SimpleDAO {
    IERC20VotesLike public govToken;

    struct Proposal {
        address target;
        uint256 value;
        bytes data;
        string description;
        uint256 deadline;
        uint256 forVotes;
        uint256 againstVotes;
        bool executed;
    }

    uint256 public constant VOTING_PERIOD = 3 days;
    uint256 public proposalCount;

    mapping(uint256 => Proposal) public proposals;
    mapping(uint256 => mapping(address => bool)) public hasVoted;

    event Proposed(uint256 indexed id, address indexed proposer, string description);
    event Voted(uint256 indexed id, address indexed voter, bool support, uint256 weight);
    event Executed(uint256 indexed id);

    constructor(address _govToken) {
        govToken = IERC20VotesLike(_govToken);
    }

    function propose(
        address target,
        uint256 value,
        bytes calldata data,
        string calldata description
    ) external returns (uint256 id) {
        id = ++proposalCount;
        proposals[id] = Proposal({
            target: target,
            value: value,
            data: data,
            description: description,
            deadline: block.timestamp + VOTING_PERIOD,
            forVotes: 0,
            againstVotes: 0,
            executed: false
        });
        emit Proposed(id, msg.sender, description);
    }

    function vote(uint256 id, bool support) external {
        Proposal storage p = proposals[id];
        require(block.timestamp < p.deadline, "Voting ended");
        require(!hasVoted[id][msg.sender], "Already voted");

        uint256 weight = govToken.balanceOf(msg.sender);
        require(weight > 0, "No voting power");

        hasVoted[id][msg.sender] = true;

        if (support) p.forVotes += weight;
        else p.againstVotes += weight;

        emit Voted(id, msg.sender, support, weight);
    }

    function execute(uint256 id) external {
        Proposal storage p = proposals[id];
        require(block.timestamp >= p.deadline, "Voting not ended");
        require(!p.executed, "Already executed");
        require(p.forVotes > p.againstVotes, "Did not pass");

        p.executed = true;
        (bool ok, ) = p.target.call{value: p.value}(p.data);
        require(ok, "Execution failed");

        emit Executed(id);
    }

    receive() external payable {}
}
```

### Example: Deploying to Sei EVM (bash)

Assuming you’re using Foundry and have Sei EVM RPC access configured:

```bash
# Set your RPC URL and private key
export RPC_URL="https://<sei-evm-rpc-url>"
export PRIVATE_KEY="<your-private-key>"

# Deploy (example)
forge create --rpc-url "$RPC_URL" \
  --private-key "$PRIVATE_KEY" \
  src/SimpleDAO.sol:SimpleDAO \
  --constructor-args <GOV_TOKEN_ADDRESS>
```

## Summary

DAOs are smart-contract-governed organizations that coordinate members through proposals, voting, and automated execution. On Sei Network, DAOs benefit from fast finality, parallelized execution, and EVM compatibility—making it easier to run active, high-participation governance and execute treasury actions efficiently.
