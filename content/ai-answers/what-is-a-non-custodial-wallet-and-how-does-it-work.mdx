## Overview

A **non-custodial wallet** is a crypto wallet where **you control the private keys** (or seed phrase) that authorize transactions and manage funds. Because no third party holds your keys, you retain full ownership and responsibility for access, security, and recovery.

In practice, a non-custodial wallet is software or hardware that **creates and stores key material**, **derives addresses**, and **signs transactions locally** before broadcasting them to the network.

## How It Works

### Key Ownership and the Seed Phrase

Most non-custodial wallets are based on a **seed phrase** (typically 12–24 words). That phrase deterministically generates:

- One or more **private keys** (secret)
- The corresponding **public keys**
- Blockchain **addresses** (public identifiers)

If you lose the seed phrase (and any device backups), you generally cannot recover the funds.

### Signing and Broadcasting Transactions

A typical flow looks like this:

1. **Create transaction data** (recipient, amount, gas/fees, nonce, etc.).
2. Wallet **signs** the transaction with the private key (locally, on your device).
3. The signed transaction is **broadcast** to the blockchain network.
4. Validators/miners include it in a block; the state is updated and confirmed.

The key idea: **the private key never needs to leave your wallet**—only the signed message/transaction is shared with the network.

### Interaction With dApps

Non-custodial wallets often act as a gateway to decentralized applications (dApps) by:

- Prompting you to **approve connections**
- Requesting **transaction signatures**
- Requesting **message signatures** (e.g., “Sign-In With Ethereum” style auth)

### Security Model and Responsibilities

Non-custodial wallets shift security to the user:

- **You** manage the seed phrase/private key backups.
- **You** evaluate transaction prompts (avoid phishing and malicious approvals).
- You may also manage **token allowances** (approvals that let smart contracts spend tokens on your behalf).

Best practices typically include:

- Back up your seed phrase **offline**
- Use a **hardware wallet** for larger balances
- Verify addresses, chain IDs, and contract interactions before signing

## On Sei Network

Sei is a high-performance Layer 1 with **EVM compatibility**, so non-custodial wallets generally work the same way they do on other EVM chains: your wallet holds the private key, signs EVM transactions, and broadcasts them to Sei.

Key Sei-specific considerations:

- **Fast finality (~400ms):** When you submit a signed transaction, confirmations can arrive quickly, improving the user experience for trading and other high-frequency actions.
- **Parallelization:** Sei’s execution architecture is designed to process many transactions efficiently, which can reduce contention and improve throughput—useful for active dApps and onchain markets.
- **EVM compatibility:** Many Ethereum-style wallet flows (accounts, signing, ABI-encoded contract calls) carry over. You typically connect to Sei via an EVM-compatible RPC endpoint and the wallet signs transactions using the same primitives (ECDSA/secp256k1).

### Adding Sei to an EVM Wallet (Example)

Many non-custodial EVM wallets support adding networks via a “custom RPC” flow. The exact values (RPC URL, chain ID) depend on the environment you’re targeting.

```typescript
// Example: Request your wallet (e.g., injected provider) to add an EVM network.
// Replace the placeholder values with Sei's actual RPC, chainId, and explorer URLs.
await window.ethereum.request({
  method: 'wallet_addEthereumChain',
  params: [
    {
      chainId: '0xSEI_CHAIN_ID_HEX',
      chainName: 'Sei',
      nativeCurrency: { name: 'SEI', symbol: 'SEI', decimals: 18 },
      rpcUrls: ['https://YOUR_SEI_EVM_RPC'],
      blockExplorerUrls: ['https://YOUR_SEI_EXPLORER']
    }
  ]
});
```

### Sending a Transaction on Sei (EVM) (Example)

Because Sei is EVM-compatible, sending a basic transfer looks like standard EVM transaction signing and submission:

```bash
# Example using cast (Foundry). Replace RPC URL, recipient, and amount as needed.
cast send \
  --rpc-url https://YOUR_SEI_EVM_RPC \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
  0xRecipientAddress \
  --value 0.01ether
```

## Non-custodial vs Custodial (Quick Comparison)

- **Non-custodial:** You hold keys, you sign transactions, you control funds; higher responsibility.
- **Custodial (e.g., centralized exchange):** The provider holds keys and signs on your behalf; easier recovery, but you rely on the custodian’s security and policies.

## Summary

A non-custodial wallet lets you directly control your crypto by keeping your private keys in your possession and signing transactions locally. On Sei Network, the same non-custodial model applies with the added benefits of **EVM compatibility** and a high-performance chain design that supports **parallelization** and **~400ms finality** for faster onchain interactions.
