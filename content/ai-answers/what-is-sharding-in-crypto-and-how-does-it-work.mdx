## Overview

Sharding is a blockchain scalability technique that splits a network’s state and transaction processing into multiple parallel “shards,” so the system can handle more activity without every node processing every transaction. Instead of a single chain doing all work, shards divide responsibilities, increasing throughput while aiming to preserve decentralization and security.

## How It Works

At a high level, sharding applies a common distributed-systems pattern—partitioning—directly to blockchain data and execution.

### 1) Partitioning the network and state

A blockchain can be partitioned in a few ways:

- **State sharding**: Accounts/storage (the “state”) are split across shards. A node may store/validate only a subset of total state.
- **Transaction sharding**: Transactions are assigned to shards so multiple sets of transactions can be executed in parallel.
- **Execution sharding**: Smart contract computation is performed on different shards concurrently.

In practice, many designs combine these.

### 2) Validators and shard committees

Rather than having all validators validate everything, validators are commonly assigned to shards (often called **committees**). Good designs periodically reshuffle committee membership to reduce the risk of a single shard being captured by an attacker.

### 3) Cross-shard communication

A major challenge is handling interactions between shards:

- **Cross-shard transfers** (e.g., moving tokens from shard A to shard B)
- **Cross-shard contract calls** (a contract on shard A calling a contract on shard B)

Because shards execute independently, cross-shard actions typically rely on message passing and proof mechanisms, such as:

- receipts/events emitted on one shard and consumed on another
- Merkle proofs / light client proofs to verify that a message was finalized
- asynchronous workflows (a “send” then later a “receive/claim”)

### 4) Finality, ordering, and data availability

Sharded systems must still guarantee:

- **Finality**: when an action is irrevocable across shards
- **Consistency**: ensuring cross-shard messages are not forged or replayed
- **Data availability**: shard data must be available so the network can verify and reconstruct the chain

Depending on the blockchain design, there may be a central coordination layer (sometimes called a beacon/relay chain) or a unified consensus that coordinates shard blocks and cross-shard proofs.

### Tradeoffs and complexity

Sharding improves throughput and can reduce per-node resource requirements, but adds complexity in:

- cross-shard contract composability (often becomes asynchronous)
- developer ergonomics (handling multi-step flows)
- security assumptions (committee selection and message verification)

## On Sei Network

Sei Network is a high-performance Layer 1 with **EVM compatibility**, designed to scale execution without relying on application-visible sharding. Instead of requiring developers to think in terms of shards and cross-shard messaging, Sei focuses on scaling via **parallelization** and fast finality.

### Parallel execution vs. sharding

- **Sharding** scales by splitting state/execution into separate partitions, introducing cross-shard coordination.
- **Sei** scales by executing many transactions **in parallel** on a single, unified network state (where safe), reducing contention and improving throughput without fragmenting liquidity or composability across shards.

This means EVM developers typically write standard Solidity contracts without needing shard-aware patterns (like asynchronous cross-shard calls), while still benefiting from high performance.

### Fast finality

Sei targets **~400ms finality**, which improves user experience for trading, payments, and other latency-sensitive apps. In sharded systems, cross-shard finality can be more complex (often involving multiple confirmations or message relay steps). Sei’s fast finality helps keep interactions responsive without cross-shard delays.

### EVM compatibility

With Sei’s EVM support, smart contracts and tooling (Solidity, Foundry/Hardhat, ethers.js) work in a familiar way. You get scalability benefits from Sei’s execution model while maintaining standard EVM developer workflows.

## Example: Cross-shard-style workflow (conceptual)

In a sharded design, a “transfer and then use funds” flow often becomes a two-step asynchronous pattern:

1. **Send** on shard A (lock/burn, emit message)
2. **Receive/claim** on shard B (verify finalized message, mint/unlock)

Conceptually (pseudocode-ish Solidity), a bridge/message-based pattern looks like:

```solidity
// Conceptual example: message-based transfer pattern used in sharded/cross-domain systems
contract SenderShard {
    event TransferInitiated(address indexed to, uint256 amount, bytes32 msgId);

    function sendToOtherShard(address to, uint256 amount) external {
        // lock/burn funds on this shard...
        bytes32 msgId = keccak256(abi.encode(to, amount, block.number));
        emit TransferInitiated(to, amount, msgId);
        // message later proven/relayed to the other shard
    }
}

contract ReceiverShard {
    mapping(bytes32 => bool) public claimed;

    function claimFromOtherShard(address to, uint256 amount, bytes32 msgId, bytes calldata proof) external {
        require(!claimed[msgId], "already claimed");
        // verify proof that msgId event was finalized on SenderShard...
        claimed[msgId] = true;
        // mint/unlock funds on this shard...
    }
}
```

On Sei, most applications do not need shard-aware messaging because execution happens on a single network state, with parallelization improving throughput behind the scenes.

## Key Takeaways

- Sharding increases blockchain scalability by splitting state and/or execution into multiple parallel partitions (shards).
- The hardest parts are cross-shard communication, composability, and maintaining security through committee assignment and proof systems.
- Sei Network scales without requiring application-visible sharding, leveraging **parallel execution**, **~400ms finality**, and **EVM compatibility** to keep development straightforward while delivering high performance.
