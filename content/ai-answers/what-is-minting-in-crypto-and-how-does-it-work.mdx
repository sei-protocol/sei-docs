# What is Minting in Crypto and How Does It Work?

## Overview

Minting in crypto is the process of creating new tokens or non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on a blockchain by recording them in a smart contract and assigning ownership. When people ask **what is minting**, they’re usually referring to how new digital assets come into existence on-chain—either as newly issued supply (fungible tokens) or as unique items (NFTs).

Unlike “printing” money off-chain, minting is verifiable: the blockchain’s state updates to reflect new token IDs or new balances, and the transaction history provides an auditable trail of creation and ownership.

## How It Works

### Minting vs. Mining (and Why People Confuse Them)

- **Mining** (typical in Proof-of-Work chains) is a consensus mechanism where miners expend computation to add blocks and may receive newly issued coins as rewards.
- **Minting** is the on-chain act of **issuing** tokens—usually via a smart contract function (e.g., `mint`) or via protocol rules (e.g., staking rewards in some Proof-of-Stake systems).

A chain can have minting without mining (most smart-contract platforms), and it can have both (e.g., mining produces blocks and issuance).

### What Actually Happens During Minting

At a high level, minting involves:

1. **Authorization**: A contract checks whether the caller is allowed to mint (e.g., contract owner, minter role, sale contract, or a permissionless rule).
2. **State update**: The contract increases total supply (fungible tokens) or creates a new token ID + metadata linkage (NFTs).
3. **Ownership assignment**: The newly minted asset is assigned to an address (the minter or a recipient).
4. **Events emitted**: Standard events (like ERC-20 `Transfer` from `0x0` or ERC-721 `Transfer` from `0x0`) signal to indexers and wallets that minting occurred.
5. **Fees/gas paid**: The transaction requires gas; some mints also require payment in native tokens or another token.

### Types of Minting

**Fungible token minting (ERC-20-like)**  
Creates interchangeable units (e.g., 1,000 tokens) and increases total supply. Often used for:

- Token launches (initial supply)
- Emissions schedules (staking rewards)
- Treasury or incentives

**NFT minting (ERC-721 / ERC-1155-like)**  
Creates a unique token ID (ERC-721) or a semi-fungible token type with a supply (ERC-1155). Used for:

- Digital art and collectibles
- Game items
- Membership/access passes
- On-chain credentials

### Common Minting Models

- **Owner/admin minting**: Only a privileged account can mint.
- **Role-based minting**: Multiple “minter” addresses can mint (e.g., using `MINTER_ROLE`).
- **Permissionless/public mint**: Anyone can mint under defined constraints (price, allowlist, max per wallet).
- **Lazy minting**: Metadata is prepared off-chain; the actual mint is executed later (often at purchase time) by a marketplace or sale contract.
- **Protocol-level minting**: Some networks mint new tokens as part of validator/staking reward distribution—implemented in the chain’s core logic rather than a user-deployed contract.

### Security and Supply Considerations

Minting directly affects supply and ownership, so best practices include:

- **Cap / max supply** to prevent infinite issuance (for many assets)
- **Access control** (e.g., owner or roles) and careful key management
- **Reentrancy-safe payments** for paid mints
- **Metadata integrity** (immutable URIs, content addressing like IPFS/Arweave, or on-chain metadata)
- **Clear emissions schedules** and transparency around inflation

## On Sei Network

On Sei, minting works the same way conceptually—assets are created by on-chain transactions that update contract or protocol state—but it benefits from Sei’s performance characteristics.

- **EVM compatibility**: You can deploy standard Solidity contracts (ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155) and use familiar minting patterns and tooling.
- **High throughput via parallelization**: Sei is designed to execute many transactions in parallel when they don’t conflict, which can help high-demand mints (e.g., NFT drops or large-scale token distributions) process more efficiently.
- **Fast finality (~400ms)**: Mint transactions can reach finality quickly, improving user experience for real-time mint flows (wallet confirmation, reveal mechanics, claim experiences).

### Example: Minting an ERC-20 Token (Solidity)

Below is a minimal ERC-20-style example showing a restricted `mint` function. (In production, prefer audited libraries like OpenZeppelin.)

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

contract SimpleERC20 {
    string public name = "Example Token";
    string public symbol = "EXM";
    uint8 public decimals = 18;

    uint256 public totalSupply;
    address public owner;

    mapping(address => uint256) public balanceOf;

    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "NOT_OWNER");
        _;
    }

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function mint(address to, uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
        require(to != address(0), "BAD_TO");

        totalSupply += amount;
        balanceOf[to] += amount;

        // ERC-20 convention: mint emits Transfer from zero address
        emit Transfer(address(0), to, amount);
    }

    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool) {
        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= amount, "INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE");
        require(to != address(0), "BAD_TO");

        balanceOf[msg.sender] -= amount;
        balanceOf[to] += amount;

        emit Transfer(msg.sender, to, amount);
        return true;
    }
}
```

### Example: Minting an NFT (ERC-721-style, Solidity)

This simplified example illustrates minting a unique token ID to a recipient.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

contract SimpleNFT {
    string public name = "Example NFT";
    string public symbol = "ENFT";

    address public owner;
    uint256 public nextTokenId;

    mapping(uint256 => address) public ownerOf;

    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 indexed tokenId);

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "NOT_OWNER");
        _;
    }

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function mint(address to) external onlyOwner returns (uint256 tokenId) {
        require(to != address(0), "BAD_TO");

        tokenId = nextTokenId++;
        ownerOf[tokenId] = to;

        // ERC-721 convention: mint emits Transfer from zero address
        emit Transfer(address(0), to, tokenId);
    }
}
```

### Example: Sending a Mint Transaction on Sei (EVM) with ethers.js

If you have a deployed token/NFT contract with a `mint` function, you can call it using standard Ethereum tooling against Sei’s EVM RPC.

```typescript
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

const RPC_URL = process.env.SEI_EVM_RPC!;
const PRIVATE_KEY = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY!;
const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = '0xYourContractAddress';

const ABI = ['function mint(address to, uint256 amount) external'];

async function main() {
  const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(RPC_URL);
  const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(PRIVATE_KEY, provider);

  const contract = new ethers.Contract(CONTRACT_ADDRESS, ABI, wallet);

  const to = '0xRecipientAddress';
  const amount = ethers.parseUnits('1000', 18);

  const tx = await contract.mint(to, amount);
  console.log('Submitted tx:', tx.hash);

  const receipt = await tx.wait();
  console.log('Confirmed in block:', receipt.blockNumber);
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

## Key Takeaways (Quick Glossary Summary)

- **What is minting**: Creating new crypto tokens or NFTs by writing their creation into a blockchain’s state.
- **How it works**: A smart contract (or protocol rules) authorizes minting, updates supply/ownership, emits events, and finalizes via consensus.
- **On Sei Network**: Minting is EVM-compatible and benefits from Sei’s parallelization and fast (~400ms) finality—useful for responsive, high-volume mint experiences.
