## Overview

Liquid staking is a way to stake crypto assets to help secure a proof-of-stake (PoS) network while receiving a “liquid” token that represents your staked position. This liquid token can typically be used across DeFi (trading, lending, liquidity provision) while your original assets remain staked and continue earning staking rewards.

## How It Works

In a traditional staking flow, you delegate tokens to a validator and, in return, you earn rewards—often with a lockup or unbonding period during which your funds can’t be freely moved. Liquid staking adds an extra layer that keeps your position transferable and usable.

### Core components

- **Staker**: Deposits a base asset (e.g., a network’s staking token) into a liquid staking protocol.
- **Validator set / delegation**: The protocol stakes (delegates) those assets to one or more validators to earn staking rewards.
- **Liquid staking token (LST)**: The protocol mints a token to you (e.g., `stToken`) that represents your claim on the underlying staked assets plus accrued rewards.
- **Rewards accounting**: Rewards are reflected either by:
  - **Rebasing**: Your LST balance increases over time, or
  - **Exchange-rate model**: The LST’s value increases relative to the underlying asset (your balance stays the same, but each LST redeems for more underlying over time).
- **Redemption / unstaking**: To exit, you burn (return) the LST and redeem the underlying stake. Depending on the protocol, redemption may be:
  - **Instant liquidity** via secondary markets (sell the LST), or
  - **Protocol withdrawal** that still follows the network’s unbonding rules.

### Why it exists

Liquid staking solves a common staking tradeoff: earning staking yield versus keeping capital usable. With an LST, you can continue participating in DeFi while still earning staking rewards—though this introduces additional smart contract and market risks.

### Benefits and risks

**Benefits**

- Maintain liquidity while staking
- Use LSTs as collateral or in liquidity pools
- Potentially compound yields by combining staking rewards with DeFi strategies

**Risks**

- **Smart contract risk**: Bugs or exploits in the liquid staking protocol
- **Validator / slashing risk**: Misbehavior can reduce underlying stake
- **Liquidity and depeg risk**: LST market price can deviate from underlying value
- **Governance risk**: Protocol changes may affect redemption, fees, or validator selection

## On Sei Network

On Sei Network, liquid staking can be especially powerful because Sei combines high performance with EVM compatibility. Sei’s parallelized execution enables higher throughput for DeFi activity around LSTs (swaps, collateral updates, liquidations), and Sei’s ~400ms finality helps LST-related transactions (minting, trading, rebalancing positions) settle quickly—improving user experience and reducing time exposed to market volatility during critical actions.

Because Sei is **EVM compatible**, liquid staking protocols and DeFi apps can be implemented with Solidity smart contracts and familiar tooling. That makes it straightforward to integrate LSTs into lending markets, DEX pools, and structured products, while benefitting from Sei’s fast finality and parallelization.

### Typical Sei liquid staking flow

1. User deposits a staking token into a liquid staking contract.
2. The protocol delegates those tokens to a set of validators.
3. The protocol mints an LST (ERC-20 style on Sei’s EVM) to the user.
4. The user can:
   - Hold the LST to maintain exposure and accrue staking yield, or
   - Use it in Sei DeFi (swap, lend, LP, collateralize).
5. To exit:
   - Swap LST back to the base asset on a DEX, or
   - Redeem via the protocol’s unstake mechanism (subject to network rules).

## Code Examples

### Minimal Solidity interface for an LST contract

The following shows a simplified pattern: deposit underlying to mint an LST, and burn LST to request redemption. Real implementations include validator delegation logic, reward accounting, fees, and safety checks.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

interface IERC20 {
    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
}

interface ILiquidStaking {
    // Deposit underlying staking asset and receive LST
    function deposit(uint256 amount) external returns (uint256 mintedLST);

    // Burn LST and redeem underlying (may be delayed depending on unbonding)
    function redeem(uint256 lstAmount) external returns (uint256 underlyingOut);
}
```

### TypeScript: approve + deposit (EVM-compatible on Sei)

```typescript
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(process.env.SEI_EVM_RPC_URL!);
const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY!, provider);

const underlying = new ethers.Contract('0xUnderlyingTokenAddress', ['function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) external returns (bool)', 'function decimals() view returns (uint8)'], wallet);

const liquidStaking = new ethers.Contract('0xLiquidStakingContract', ['function deposit(uint256 amount) external returns (uint256)'], wallet);

async function stake(amount: bigint) {
  // 1) Approve underlying spend
  const approveTx = await underlying.approve(await liquidStaking.getAddress(), amount);
  await approveTx.wait();

  // 2) Deposit to mint LST
  const depositTx = await liquidStaking.deposit(amount);
  const receipt = await depositTx.wait();

  console.log('Deposited. Tx:', receipt?.hash);
}

stake(1_000_000n); // Example base-unit amount
```

## Key Takeaways

- Liquid staking lets you earn PoS staking rewards while receiving a transferable token (LST) representing your staked position.
- LSTs enable staking capital to remain productive in DeFi, but add smart contract, slashing, and liquidity/depeg risks.
- On Sei, liquid staking and LST-based DeFi can benefit from parallelized execution, ~400ms finality, and EVM compatibility for seamless integration with Solidity-based applications.
