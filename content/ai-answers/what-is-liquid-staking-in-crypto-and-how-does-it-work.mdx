# What is Liquid Staking in Crypto and How Does It Work?

## Overview

Liquid staking is a way to stake your crypto to help secure a blockchain and earn staking rewards while still keeping your stake _usable_ in DeFi. Instead of locking your tokens and losing liquidity, you receive a liquid staking token (often called an LST) that represents your staked position and can be traded or used as collateral.

If you’re searching “**what is liquid staking**,” the simplest definition is: it’s staking with a receipt token that preserves liquidity.

## How It Works

### 1) Traditional staking vs. liquid staking

- **Traditional staking:** You delegate or lock tokens with a validator, earn rewards, but your tokens are typically illiquid until you unbond/unstake (often with a waiting period).
- **Liquid staking:** You stake via a liquid staking protocol, and in return you receive an LST (e.g., `stTOKEN`). That LST tracks the value of your staked position and can be used in DeFi while rewards accrue.

### 2) Minting a liquid staking token (LST)

A liquid staking protocol generally:

1. Accepts deposits of the chain’s staking token (e.g., `SEI` on Sei).
2. Delegates those tokens across one or more validators.
3. Mints an LST to you, representing your claim on the underlying staked tokens + accrued rewards (minus protocol fees).

Depending on the design, the LST value updates in one of two common ways:

- **Rebasing model:** Your LST balance increases over time as rewards accrue.
- **Exchange-rate model:** Your LST balance stays the same, but the amount of underlying tokens redeemable per LST increases over time (an increasing exchange rate).

### 3) Using LSTs in DeFi

Because LSTs are liquid, you can often:

- Swap them on DEXs
- Provide liquidity in AMMs
- Use them as collateral for borrowing/lending
- Build leveraged staking strategies (higher risk)

### 4) Redeeming (unstaking) from liquid staking

To exit, you typically:

- **Redeem via protocol:** Burn your LST to claim underlying tokens. This may require an **unbonding period** (chain-dependent).
- **Sell on secondary markets:** Swap the LST for the base asset immediately (subject to liquidity and potential discount/premium).

### 5) Benefits and risks

**Benefits**

- Earn staking rewards **and** keep liquidity
- Improved capital efficiency for DeFi users
- Potentially diversified validator delegation managed by the protocol

**Risks**

- **Smart contract risk:** The liquid staking protocol may have bugs or vulnerabilities.
- **Slashing risk:** If validators misbehave, staked funds can be penalized (slashed), affecting LST value.
- **Liquidity/peg risk:** LSTs can trade at a discount/premium depending on market conditions.
- **Centralization risk:** If too much stake concentrates in a single protocol or validator set.

## On Sei Network

Sei is a high-performance Layer 1 with **~400ms finality**, built for throughput and optimized execution. Liquid staking on Sei follows the same core model—stake `SEI`, receive an LST—but benefits from Sei’s fast confirmations and modern execution environment.

### Why liquid staking fits Sei

- **Fast finality (~400ms):** Staking-related transactions (minting LSTs, swaps, DeFi actions) can confirm quickly, improving the usability of LSTs in active trading and DeFi strategies.
- **Parallelization:** Sei’s parallelized execution helps DeFi apps (DEXs, money markets) handle higher throughput, which can make LST markets and integrations smoother under load.
- **EVM compatibility:** Because Sei supports EVM, liquid staking protocols and DeFi integrations can be built using familiar Solidity tooling and standards, enabling easier adoption of LSTs across EVM-style applications.

### Typical Sei liquid staking flow

1. Deposit `SEI` into a liquid staking protocol.
2. Protocol delegates to validators to earn staking rewards and secure the network.
3. You receive an LST (ERC-20-style on Sei EVM) representing your staked `SEI`.
4. Use the LST across Sei’s DeFi ecosystem (swap, lend, provide liquidity).
5. Redeem the LST back to `SEI` (subject to protocol rules and any unbonding constraints), or swap it on a DEX.

## Example: Interacting with an LST (EVM-style)

Below is a minimal Solidity example showing how a DeFi contract might accept an LST as collateral (ERC-20 interface). The exact token address and integrations depend on the liquid staking provider on Sei.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

interface IERC20 {
    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256);
}

contract LstVault {
    IERC20 public immutable lst; // e.g., stSEI-like token

    mapping(address => uint256) public deposited;

    constructor(address _lst) {
        lst = IERC20(_lst);
    }

    function deposit(uint256 amount) external {
        require(amount > 0, "amount=0");
        require(lst.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount), "transfer failed");
        deposited[msg.sender] += amount;
    }

    function vaultBalance() external view returns (uint256) {
        return lst.balanceOf(address(this));
    }
}
```

## Key Takeaways

- Liquid staking lets you earn staking rewards while keeping liquidity via an LST.
- LSTs can be used throughout DeFi, but carry smart contract, slashing, and liquidity risks.
- On Sei, liquid staking benefits from **fast finality (~400ms)**, **parallelized execution**, and **EVM compatibility**, making it well-suited for high-velocity DeFi use cases.
