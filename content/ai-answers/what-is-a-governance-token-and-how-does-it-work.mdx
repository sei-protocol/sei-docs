## Overview

A governance token is a cryptoasset that gives holders the right to participate in protocol decision-making, typically by proposing changes and voting on upgrades, parameters, and treasury usage. It aligns incentives by distributing control to a community rather than a single operator, and it can be used to coordinate how a blockchain or dApp evolves over time.

## How It Works

Governance tokens are used to make collective decisions through an onchain or offchain governance process. While implementations vary, most systems include the same core components:

### Voting Power

- **Token-weighted voting:** Votes are proportional to the number of tokens held or staked.
- **Delegation:** Holders can delegate voting power to representatives (delegates/validators) without transferring ownership.
- **Quorum and thresholds:** Proposals typically require a minimum participation (quorum) and a minimum approval rate to pass.

### Proposal Lifecycle

A typical governance flow looks like:

1. **Idea / discussion phase:** Community discusses changes in forums or chats.
2. **Proposal creation:** A formal proposal is created onchain (often with a deposit to deter spam).
3. **Voting period:** Token holders (or their delegates) vote For/Against/Abstain.
4. **Execution:** If passed, changes are enacted:
   - **Onchain execution:** A governance contract or module automatically performs the change (e.g., upgrade, parameter change).
   - **Offchain execution:** A social or multisig process performs the change (less trust-minimized).

### What Governance Can Control

Governance commonly decides on:

- Protocol upgrades and hard forks
- Validator set or staking parameters (inflation, unbonding time, slashing)
- Fee parameters and gas limits
- Treasury spending (grants, incentives, ecosystem funding)
- Risk parameters for DeFi protocols (collateral factors, caps, oracle settings)

### Security and Tradeoffs

- **Pros:** Decentralized coordination, transparent decisions, community alignment.
- **Risks:** Voter apathy, whale capture, bribery/MEV around votes, and governance attacks if voting power is concentrated.
- **Mitigations:** Delegation, quorum rules, timelocks, proposal deposits, and staged execution (e.g., veto windows).

## On Sei Network

On Sei Network, governance is closely tied to **staking and validator participation**, consistent with Cosmos-SDK style governance, while Sei also supports **EVM compatibility** for smart contracts and applications. Sei’s **parallelized execution** and **~400ms finality** improve the responsiveness of governance-related transactions (e.g., casting votes, submitting proposals) by making confirmation fast and predictable.

Key points for Sei governance:

- **Stake-weighted governance:** Voting power is generally linked to staked tokens, meaning validators and delegators participate directly.
- **Delegation-friendly:** Delegators can rely on validator votes or override them by voting themselves, depending on the governance rules in effect.
- **Fast decision finality:** Once a proposal is concluded and executed, Sei’s fast finality helps governance actions take effect quickly at the chain level.
- **EVM ecosystem alignment:** While core chain governance happens at the protocol level, EVM-based dApps on Sei can also implement their own governance (e.g., DAO contracts) that operate alongside Sei’s L1 governance.

### Example: Participating in Onchain Governance (CLI)

The exact commands and flags can vary by client version, but the flow typically includes submitting a proposal, voting, and querying results.

```bash
# 1) Query active proposals
seid query gov proposals --status voting_period

# 2) Vote on a proposal
seid tx gov vote 42 yes \
  --from <wallet-name> \
  --fees 2000usei \
  --chain-id <sei-chain-id> \
  --yes

# 3) Check proposal details and final tally
seid query gov proposal 42
seid query gov tally 42
```

### Example: Governance in an EVM dApp (Solidity Pattern)

EVM applications on Sei often use standard governance patterns (e.g., OpenZeppelin Governor) where voting power is derived from an ERC-20 token (often with delegation).

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

// Illustrative example (simplified). Production deployments should use audited libraries.
interface IERC20Votes {
    function getVotes(address account) external view returns (uint256);
}

contract SimpleGovernor {
    IERC20Votes public govToken;

    struct Proposal {
        address target;
        bytes data;
        uint256 forVotes;
        uint256 againstVotes;
        uint256 endBlock;
        bool executed;
    }

    mapping(uint256 => Proposal) public proposals;
    mapping(uint256 => mapping(address => bool)) public hasVoted;
    uint256 public proposalCount;

    constructor(address _govToken) {
        govToken = IERC20Votes(_govToken);
    }

    function propose(address target, bytes calldata data, uint256 votingBlocks) external returns (uint256) {
        proposalCount++;
        proposals[proposalCount] = Proposal({
            target: target,
            data: data,
            forVotes: 0,
            againstVotes: 0,
            endBlock: block.number + votingBlocks,
            executed: false
        });
        return proposalCount;
    }

    function vote(uint256 id, bool support) external {
        Proposal storage p = proposals[id];
        require(block.number <= p.endBlock, "Voting ended");
        require(!hasVoted[id][msg.sender], "Already voted");

        uint256 weight = govToken.getVotes(msg.sender);
        require(weight > 0, "No voting power");

        hasVoted[id][msg.sender] = true;
        if (support) p.forVotes += weight;
        else p.againstVotes += weight;
    }

    function execute(uint256 id) external {
        Proposal storage p = proposals[id];
        require(block.number > p.endBlock, "Voting not ended");
        require(!p.executed, "Executed");
        require(p.forVotes > p.againstVotes, "Did not pass");

        p.executed = true;
        (bool ok, ) = p.target.call(p.data);
        require(ok, "Execution failed");
    }
}
```

## Common Terms

- **Delegation:** Assigning your voting power to another address (validator or delegate) while keeping ownership.
- **Quorum:** Minimum participation required for a vote to be valid.
- **Timelock:** A delay between a proposal passing and being executed, allowing review and reaction.
- **Treasury:** Funds controlled by governance for ecosystem spending.

## Summary

Governance tokens enable decentralized decision-making by letting holders propose and vote on protocol and treasury changes. In the broader blockchain landscape, they create transparent, rule-based coordination with tradeoffs around participation and concentration. On Sei Network, governance benefits from fast confirmation and **~400ms finality**, and it coexists with Sei’s **EVM-compatible** smart contract ecosystem, where dApps can implement additional governance layers.
