## Overview

A wrapped token is a blockchain token that represents another asset—usually from a different chain—at a fixed exchange rate (typically 1:1). Wrapping lets an asset be used in ecosystems where the original asset is not natively supported, enabling trading, lending, liquidity provision, and smart contract interactions on the destination network.

## How It Works

Wrapped tokens are designed to mirror the value of an underlying asset while remaining fully compatible with the destination chain’s token standard (e.g., ERC-20). The general flow looks like this:

1. **Lock (or Custody) the Original Asset**

   - The original asset is deposited into a smart contract (trust-minimized) or held by a custodian (trusted).
   - This deposit acts as backing for the wrapped token supply.

2. **Mint the Wrapped Token**

   - Once the deposit is verified, an equivalent amount of wrapped tokens is minted on the destination chain.
   - The wrapped token follows the destination chain’s standard (commonly ERC-20), so it can plug into DEXs, lending protocols, and other dApps.

3. **Use the Wrapped Token in DeFi / dApps**

   - Users can transfer it, add liquidity, borrow against it, or use it as collateral—just like any other native token on that chain.

4. **Redeem (Unwrap)**
   - The user burns (destroys) the wrapped tokens on the destination chain.
   - The original asset is released from the lock/custody back to the user on the origin chain.

### Key Properties and Considerations

- **Peg (Usually 1:1):** The wrapped token’s supply should always be backed by the underlying asset in equal quantity.
- **Security Model:** Wrapping can be:
  - **Trust-minimized:** smart contracts + decentralized validation/bridging mechanisms.
  - **Custodial:** a centralized entity holds reserves and mints/burns.
- **Bridge Risk:** Most wrapped tokens rely on bridges, which can introduce smart contract risk, validator risk, or operational risk.
- **Liquidity and Pricing:** Even if the peg is intended to be 1:1, market conditions and liquidity can cause short-term deviations on exchanges.

## On Sei Network

On Sei, wrapped tokens commonly appear when assets from other chains (like Ethereum or other ecosystems) are bridged into Sei so they can be used in Sei-native applications. Because Sei is EVM-compatible, wrapped assets often come as ERC-20 tokens that work seamlessly with Solidity smart contracts, wallets, and tooling.

Sei’s architecture (including parallelization) helps dApps handle high throughput use cases such as active trading and liquidity provisioning, while Sei’s fast finality (around **~400ms**) improves the user experience for bridging-related interactions once assets are on Sei—like swaps, collateral updates, and transfers.

### Example: Using a Wrapped ERC-20 on Sei (Solidity)

Wrapped tokens on Sei typically behave like standard ERC-20 tokens. Here’s a minimal example that transfers a wrapped token (e.g., `wTOKEN`) from the caller to a recipient:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

interface IERC20 {
    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    function balanceOf(address owner) external view returns (uint256);
}

contract WrappedTokenExample {
    IERC20 public wrappedToken;

    constructor(address wrappedTokenAddress) {
        wrappedToken = IERC20(wrappedTokenAddress);
    }

    function sendWrappedToken(address to, uint256 amount) external {
        // Caller must have enough balance and have acquired the token via a bridge or DEX.
        require(wrappedToken.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        require(wrappedToken.transfer(to, amount), "Transfer failed");
    }
}
```

### Example: Checking a Wrapped Token Balance (TypeScript + ethers)

```typescript
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

const RPC_URL = 'https://your-sei-evm-rpc.example';
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(RPC_URL);

const erc20Abi = ['function balanceOf(address owner) view returns (uint256)', 'function decimals() view returns (uint8)'];

async function main() {
  const wrappedTokenAddress = '0xYourWrappedTokenOnSei';
  const user = '0xUserAddress';

  const token = new ethers.Contract(wrappedTokenAddress, erc20Abi, provider);
  const [rawBal, decimals] = await Promise.all([token.balanceOf(user), token.decimals()]);

  const formatted = ethers.formatUnits(rawBal, decimals);
  console.log('Wrapped token balance:', formatted);
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

## Common Use Cases

- **Trading on DEXs:** Access liquidity and markets on the destination chain.
- **Lending/Borrowing:** Use wrapped assets as collateral or borrow against them.
- **Liquidity Provision:** Provide liquidity in pools that require the destination chain’s token standard.
- **Cross-ecosystem Access:** Participate in Sei-based dApps using value from other networks.

## Summary

Wrapped tokens let an asset from one chain be represented on another chain in a standard, app-compatible format—usually backed 1:1 by locked or custodied reserves. On Sei, wrapped tokens are often bridged-in ERC-20s that can be used across EVM smart contracts and DeFi apps, benefiting from Sei’s parallelized execution and fast finality for a smoother on-chain experience once assets arrive.
