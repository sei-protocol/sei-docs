## Overview

A **consensus mechanism** is the set of rules and processes a blockchain network uses to **agree on the valid state of the ledger**—which transactions are accepted, in what order, and what the latest block is. It enables decentralized participants (validators/nodes) to reach agreement **without a central authority**, even in the presence of faulty or malicious actors.

## How It Works

At a high level, consensus mechanisms solve three core problems:

- **Agreement:** honest nodes converge on the same chain/state.
- **Ordering:** transactions are placed into a deterministic sequence (block order).
- **Finality:** once a block is confirmed, the network defines when it becomes effectively irreversible.

While designs vary, most consensus systems follow a similar lifecycle:

1. **Transaction propagation**

   - Users submit signed transactions to the network.
   - Nodes gossip transactions to peers.

2. **Block proposal / production**

   - A designated node (or committee) proposes a block of transactions.
   - Selection is typically based on stake, randomness, or a schedule.

3. **Validation**

   - Nodes verify proposed blocks: signatures, balances, nonces, execution results, and protocol rules.
   - Invalid blocks are rejected.

4. **Voting / confirmation**

   - Validators exchange votes (or proofs) to decide whether to accept the proposed block.
   - In Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) systems, blocks are finalized when a supermajority threshold is reached (often **≥ 2/3** of voting power).

5. **Finalization**
   - With **deterministic finality** (common in BFT-based Proof of Stake), once finalized, the block will not be reverted unless extreme fault assumptions are violated.
   - With **probabilistic finality** (common in Proof of Work-style longest-chain systems), confidence increases as more blocks build on top.

### Common Types of Consensus Mechanisms

- **Proof of Work (PoW)**

  - Miners solve computational puzzles to propose blocks.
  - Security comes from energy/cost to rewrite history; finality is typically probabilistic.

- **Proof of Stake (PoS)**

  - Validators lock stake and are selected to propose/attest blocks.
  - Misbehavior can be punished via slashing; finality is often faster and can be deterministic with BFT voting.

- **BFT-style Consensus (often paired with PoS)**
  - Validators run rounds of proposal and voting to finalize blocks.
  - Tolerates Byzantine faults up to a threshold (commonly < 1/3 of voting power).

## On Sei Network

Sei Network uses a high-performance, Proof of Stake–based consensus approach designed for **fast finality and high throughput**. A key practical outcome for developers and users is **~400ms finality**, which reduces confirmation latency and improves UX for trading, gaming, and other real-time applications.

Sei’s architecture complements consensus with execution optimizations:

- **Parallelization:** Sei is built to process independent transactions concurrently, improving throughput under load while still producing a single agreed-upon finalized chain state.
- **EVM compatibility:** Sei supports Ethereum tooling and smart contracts, so applications can rely on familiar transaction semantics (nonces, gas, signatures) while benefiting from Sei’s performance characteristics.

In practice, consensus on Sei determines:

- which validator proposes the next block,
- which transactions enter that block and in what order,
- and when the block becomes finalized (typically within hundreds of milliseconds).

### Developer Implications

- **Fast confirmations:** Applications can treat finalized blocks as settled quickly, enabling responsive on-chain workflows.
- **High throughput under load:** Parallel execution reduces contention where transactions don’t conflict, while consensus ensures all nodes still agree on the same final state.

### Example: Waiting for Finality (EVM)

Below is a simple TypeScript example using `ethers` to send a transaction and wait for confirmation (Sei’s fast finality means this typically completes quickly in practice, depending on network conditions):

```typescript
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

const rpcUrl = process.env.RPC_URL!;
const pk = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY!;

async function main() {
  const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(rpcUrl);
  const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(pk, provider);

  const tx = await wallet.sendTransaction({
    to: '0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD',
    value: ethers.parseEther('0.001')
  });

  console.log('tx hash:', tx.hash);

  // Wait for 1 confirmation (often effectively finalized quickly on Sei)
  const receipt = await tx.wait(1);
  console.log('included in block:', receipt?.blockNumber);
  console.log('status:', receipt?.status);
}

main().catch((e) => {
  console.error(e);
  process.exit(1);
});
```

## Summary

A consensus mechanism is what allows a blockchain to stay synchronized and secure by defining how nodes propose, validate, vote on, and finalize blocks. On Sei Network, consensus is paired with **parallelized execution** and delivers **~400ms finality**, while maintaining **EVM compatibility** for familiar developer workflows.
