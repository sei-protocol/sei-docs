# What is Slashing in Crypto and How Does It Work?

## Overview

Slashing is a penalty mechanism in proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains where a validator (or their delegators) loses some of their staked tokens for breaking consensus rules or failing to perform required duties. In short, _what is slashing_ refers to the on-chain enforcement that makes attacks and persistent misbehavior economically costly, helping keep the network secure and reliable.

## How It Works

In PoS systems, validators lock up stake to earn rewards for proposing/attesting blocks and maintaining uptime. Slashing creates “skin in the game” by making the stake _at risk_ if a validator acts maliciously or negligently.

### Why slashing exists

- **Economic security:** Attackers must risk real value; penalties can exceed potential profit.
- **Safety guarantees:** Discourages actions that could cause consensus failures or chain forks.
- **Reliability:** Incentivizes validators to stay online and correctly participate.

### Common behaviors that can trigger slashing

Exact conditions vary by chain, but often include:

- **Double-signing / equivocation:** Signing two conflicting blocks or votes for the same height/round.
- **Surround vote / conflicting attestations:** Protocol-specific forms of voting inconsistencies (common in some PoS designs).
- **Extended downtime (in some networks):** Missing too many required votes/blocks can lead to penalties (sometimes “jailing” rather than stake loss, depending on the chain’s design).

### What typically happens when a validator is slashed

1. **Detection:** On-chain evidence of misbehavior is submitted or automatically observed.
2. **Penalty:** A portion of the validator’s stake is burned or redistributed (chain-specific).
3. **Jailing / tombstoning (optional):** The validator may be temporarily removed from the active set or permanently banned.
4. **Unbonding impact:** Funds may be locked for an unbonding period; slashing can occur during this window on many PoS chains.
5. **Delegator impact:** Delegators may share the penalty proportionally because they chose that validator (varies by chain and configuration).

### Slashing vs. jailing

- **Slashing:** Economic penalty (loss of stake).
- **Jailing:** Operational penalty (removal from validator set for a time). A validator can be jailed without being slashed, or both can occur together, depending on the offense.

## On Sei Network

Sei Network is a high-performance Layer 1 with EVM compatibility and fast finality (often ~400ms). Like other PoS networks, Sei relies on validators staking tokens and following consensus rules; slashing/jailing mechanisms help ensure validators remain honest and available so the network can maintain strong safety guarantees even under high throughput and parallel execution.

Key points for Sei:

- **Consensus security at high speed:** Sei’s rapid finality means the network depends on validators behaving correctly and consistently; slashing discourages equivocation and other consensus violations that could undermine finality.
- **Operational reliability:** Validator availability is critical to keep block production smooth and maintain performance. Downtime penalties (often implemented as jailing and/or slashing depending on the specific parameters) incentivize robust infrastructure.
- **EVM compatibility doesn’t change slashing mechanics:** Slashing applies to validator behavior at the consensus layer, not to EVM smart contract execution. EVM contracts can still integrate staking-related data or monitor validator status via on-chain queries, but they do not “slash” validators directly (that’s protocol-governed).

> Note: The exact slashing percentages, jailing durations, and conditions are defined by Sei’s on-chain parameters and can evolve via governance.

## Practical Implications for Users and Delegators

If you delegate stake to a validator:

- You earn rewards when the validator performs well.
- You take on **shared risk**: if that validator is slashed, your delegated stake can be reduced proportionally.
- Choosing reputable validators (uptime, history, security practices) is essential risk management.

If you run a validator:

- Use redundant infrastructure, monitoring, and secure key management (HSMs/remote signers where applicable).
- Avoid configurations that could cause double-signing (e.g., running the same validator key on multiple active nodes without safeguards).

## Example: Checking Validator / Staking State (Cosmos SDK-style CLI)

Sei is built on Cosmos SDK foundations, so many networks in this ecosystem expose staking and validator data through standard interfaces. Exact commands may differ by Sei version and tooling, but typical patterns look like:

```bash
# Query validator info (operator address format)
seid query staking validator <sei-valoper-address>

# Query slashing signing info (consensus address format)
seid query slashing signing-info <sei-valcons-address>

# Query staking params (may include unbonding time, etc.)
seid query staking params
```

## Example: Reading Staking Data Programmatically (TypeScript via REST)

Many Cosmos-based chains expose REST endpoints (via LCD or similar). A simplified example:

```typescript
import fetch from 'node-fetch';

async function getValidator(valoper: string) {
  const url = `https://<sei-rest-endpoint>/cosmos/staking/v1beta1/validators/${valoper}`;
  const res = await fetch(url);
  if (!res.ok) throw new Error(`HTTP ${res.status}`);
  return res.json();
}

(async () => {
  const data = await getValidator('seivaloper1...');
  console.log(data.validator?.description?.moniker, data.validator?.commission);
})();
```

## Key Takeaways

- **What is slashing:** a protocol-level penalty that reduces a validator’s stake when they break consensus rules or violate required behavior.
- **How it works:** misbehavior is proven on-chain, a stake penalty is applied, and the validator may be jailed/removed from active duty.
- **On Sei Network:** slashing supports consensus security and reliability, complementing Sei’s high throughput, parallelization, and fast (~400ms) finality while remaining independent of EVM smart contract logic.
