# What is a Layer 1 Blockchain and How Does It Work?

## Overview

A **Layer 1 (L1) blockchain** is a base, independent blockchain network that processes transactions, secures data, and reaches consensus **directly on its own chain**—without relying on another blockchain for security or settlement. In other words, when people ask **“what is layer 1 blockchain”**, they mean the foundational network layer where blocks are produced, transactions are finalized, and the chain’s security model lives.

Layer 1s typically provide the core features of a blockchain: a ledger, a consensus mechanism, a native asset for fees, and the ability to run applications (directly or via smart contracts).

## How It Works

### 1) Core Components of a Layer 1

A Layer 1 blockchain generally includes:

- **Consensus**: The method nodes use to agree on the next block (e.g., Proof of Stake, Proof of Work).
- **Networking**: Peer-to-peer communication for propagating transactions and blocks.
- **Execution**: The rules for validating and applying transactions (and smart contracts, if supported).
- **Data availability & storage**: The chain stores block data so anyone can verify state transitions.
- **Finality**: The point at which transactions are considered irreversible (economic or deterministic finality depending on the design).

### 2) Transaction Lifecycle on an L1 (High Level)

1. **User signs and broadcasts** a transaction to the network.
2. **Validators/nodes verify** basic correctness (signature, nonce, fee, etc.).
3. **Transactions enter a mempool** (pending pool), awaiting inclusion.
4. A **block producer** proposes a block containing a set of transactions.
5. The network reaches **consensus** on the block.
6. The chain **executes** the transactions to update state.
7. After enough confirmations or once finality is reached, the transaction is **considered final**.

### 3) What Makes an L1 Different from Layer 2?

- **Layer 1**: Provides the base security and settlement; consensus and data live on the chain itself.
- **Layer 2**: Builds on top of an L1 to improve scalability/costs (e.g., rollups), usually inheriting security from the L1.

### 4) Common L1 Scaling Approaches

Layer 1 networks improve throughput and latency using techniques such as:

- **Faster block times / quicker finality**
- **Parallel execution** (running independent transactions concurrently)
- **Optimized consensus and networking**
- **State and storage optimizations**

## On Sei Network

Sei is a **high-performance Layer 1 blockchain** designed for low-latency execution and modern app requirements, while also supporting **EVM compatibility** for Ethereum-style smart contracts.

### Parallelization and Performance

On Sei, Layer 1 scaling is achieved with strong performance characteristics and **parallelization**—allowing many non-conflicting transactions to be processed concurrently—helping increase throughput and reduce contention. Sei is also known for **~400ms finality**, enabling near-instant user experiences for trading, gaming, and other real-time applications.

### EVM Compatibility

Sei’s EVM compatibility means developers can deploy and run Solidity smart contracts and integrate with familiar Ethereum tooling (wallets, libraries, and developer workflows). This makes it easier to build on a high-performance L1 without abandoning the Ethereum ecosystem.

### Example: Deploying a Simple Solidity Contract (EVM)

Below is a minimal Solidity contract you can deploy to Sei’s EVM environment.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

contract Counter {
    uint256 public count;

    function inc() external {
        count += 1;
    }

    function dec() external {
        require(count > 0, "count underflow");
        count -= 1;
    }
}
```

### Example: Sending a Transaction with ethers.js (TypeScript)

This example connects to an RPC endpoint and calls `inc()`.

```typescript
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

async function main() {
  // Replace with Sei EVM RPC endpoint
  const rpcUrl = process.env.RPC_URL as string;
  const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(rpcUrl);

  // Use a funded private key for Sei EVM
  const pk = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY as string;
  const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(pk, provider);

  // Deployed contract address on Sei EVM
  const counterAddress = '0xYourContractAddress';

  const abi = ['function count() view returns (uint256)', 'function inc()'];

  const counter = new ethers.Contract(counterAddress, abi, wallet);

  const before = await counter.count();
  console.log('count before:', before.toString());

  const tx = await counter.inc();
  console.log('tx hash:', tx.hash);

  await tx.wait(); // waits for inclusion/finality per provider semantics
  const after = await counter.count();
  console.log('count after:', after.toString());
}

main().catch((e) => {
  console.error(e);
  process.exit(1);
});
```

### Why “Layer 1” Matters for Builders and Users on Sei

Because Sei is an L1, it provides:

- **Native settlement and security** directly on-chain (no external settlement layer required)
- **Fast finality (~400ms)** for responsive applications
- **Parallelized execution** to scale throughput efficiently
- **EVM compatibility** to reuse Ethereum contracts and tooling

## Key Takeaways

- A **Layer 1 blockchain** is the foundational network that runs consensus, executes transactions, and finalizes state on its own chain.
- L1s are responsible for **security, settlement, and data availability**, and can scale via performance-focused designs like **parallel execution**.
- **Sei Network** is a high-performance L1 with **parallelization**, **~400ms finality**, and **EVM compatibility**, making it well-suited for low-latency, high-throughput applications.
