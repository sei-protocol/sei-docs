## Overview

Delegated staking is a method of participating in a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain’s security and consensus by assigning (“delegating”) your staking power to a validator instead of running validator infrastructure yourself. You keep ownership of your tokens, while the validator uses the combined stake to propose/attest blocks and earn rewards that are shared with delegators (minus a commission).

It’s commonly used to make staking accessible to more users, increase decentralization, and aggregate stake behind reliable validators.

## How It Works

### 1) Validators and delegators

- **Validators** run always-on infrastructure (nodes), participate in consensus, and receive rewards for correct behavior.
- **Delegators** stake by delegating tokens (or “voting power”) to a validator, helping that validator meet stake requirements and improve chances of being selected in consensus.

### 2) Rewards and commission

- Networks typically distribute rewards from sources such as:
  - **Inflation** (newly minted tokens)
  - **Transaction fees**
- Validators set a **commission rate** (e.g., 5%–10%) that is taken from rewards before the remainder is distributed to delegators proportionally to their delegated stake.

### 3) Slashing and risk

Delegated staking usually includes **slashing**, a penalty applied when a validator misbehaves (e.g., double-signing, prolonged downtime). Because delegators’ stake is bonded to the validator’s performance, delegators can lose a portion of their stake if the validator is slashed.

### 4) Bonding, unbonding, and redelegation

Depending on the chain, staking involves:

- **Bonding/Delegating:** your tokens become staked (often locked or “bonded”).
- **Unbonding/Undelegating:** withdrawing stake typically requires a waiting period (an “unbonding period”).
- **Redelegation:** switching validators sometimes happens immediately or with restrictions (cooldowns).

### 5) Governance participation

In many PoS networks, staked tokens also carry **governance voting power**. Delegators may:

- Inherit their validator’s vote by default, or
- Override it by voting directly (chain-specific).

## On Sei Network

Sei is a high-performance Layer 1 with **EVM compatibility** and fast, deterministic execution characteristics (including **~400ms finality**). Delegated staking on Sei follows the common PoS delegation model: users delegate stake to validators who secure the network and participate in consensus, while delegators earn rewards based on their share of the validator’s total stake.

Key points for Sei:

- **Performance and finality:** With ~400ms finality, delegation supports a network designed for rapid confirmation and high throughput.
- **Parallelization-aware execution:** Sei’s architecture emphasizes **parallelization**, improving throughput for supported workloads; staking helps keep the validator set robust as the chain processes transactions quickly.
- **EVM compatibility:** Developers can deploy EVM smart contracts while the base chain remains secured by PoS validators and delegators. Staking is handled at the protocol level (consensus/security), while EVM apps benefit from the secured execution environment.

## Typical Delegated Staking Flow

1. **Choose a validator**
   - Evaluate uptime, commission, reputation, decentralization goals, and operational transparency.
2. **Delegate tokens**
   - Your stake contributes to that validator’s voting power.
3. **Earn rewards**
   - Rewards accrue over time; you may need to claim/withdraw depending on chain mechanics and wallet tooling.
4. **Manage risk**
   - If the validator is slashed, delegators can be penalized. Diversifying across validators can reduce concentration risk.
5. **Undelegate or redelegate**
   - Switch validators or exit staking (often with an unbonding delay).

## Example Commands (Cosmos-SDK Style)

Sei is built in the Cosmos ecosystem, and staking interactions are commonly performed via CLI patterns similar to Cosmos-SDK chains.

### Delegate to a validator

```bash
seid tx staking delegate <validator-operator-address> 1000000usei \
  --from <your-key-name> \
  --chain-id <sei-chain-id> \
  --gas auto --gas-adjustment 1.3 --fees 2000usei
```

### Check delegations

```bash
seid query staking delegations <your-account-address>
```

### Withdraw staking rewards

```bash
seid tx distribution withdraw-rewards <validator-operator-address> \
  --from <your-key-name> \
  --commission \
  --chain-id <sei-chain-id> \
  --gas auto --gas-adjustment 1.3 --fees 2000usei
```

### Redelegate to a new validator

```bash
seid tx staking redelegate <src-validator-operator> <dst-validator-operator> 500000usei \
  --from <your-key-name> \
  --chain-id <sei-chain-id> \
  --gas auto --gas-adjustment 1.3 --fees 2000usei
```

> Note: Exact flags, denominations, and chain IDs can vary by network and release; consult Sei’s official docs and your wallet/CLI version.

## Best Practices for Delegators

- **Compare commission vs. performance:** Lowest commission isn’t always best if uptime is poor.
- **Review validator operations:** Look for public infrastructure details, monitoring, and incident history.
- **Avoid centralization:** Delegating only to the largest validators can reduce network resilience.
- **Understand unbonding rules:** Plan for liquidity needs because staked funds may be locked during unbonding.
- **Monitor slashing conditions:** Know what behaviors cause penalties and how your chosen validator mitigates them.

## Summary

Delegated staking lets token holders contribute to network security and earn staking rewards by assigning stake to professional validators. In exchange for convenience, delegators accept validator-related risks (like slashing) and typically face lockups or unbonding periods. On Sei Network, delegated staking secures a fast, parallelization-focused Layer 1 with ~400ms finality and EVM compatibility, enabling scalable on-chain activity backed by a PoS validator set.
