## Overview

A **hot wallet** is a cryptocurrency wallet that stays connected to the internet to make signing and sending transactions fast and convenient. It typically stores private keys (or key material) in a device or browser environment that can communicate with blockchain networks in real time. Because it’s online, a hot wallet is easier to use for everyday activity but generally carries higher security risk than an offline (“cold”) wallet.

## How It Works

Hot wallets revolve around **key management** and **transaction signing**:

- **Keys and addresses**

  - A wallet generates (or imports) a **seed phrase** (mnemonic) that deterministically derives private keys and public addresses.
  - The **public address** is used to receive funds.
  - The **private key** (or derived keys) authorizes spending and must remain secret.

- **Creating and signing transactions**

  1. The user initiates an action (send tokens, swap, interact with a dApp).
  2. The wallet constructs a transaction payload (recipient, amount, fees, chain ID, nonce/sequence, and any contract calldata).
  3. The wallet signs it locally with the private key.
  4. The signed transaction is broadcast to the network via an RPC endpoint.
  5. Validators include it in a block; the state updates after confirmation/finality.

- **Common hot wallet types**

  - **Browser extension wallets** (e.g., MetaMask-like): convenient for dApps.
  - **Mobile wallets**: on-the-go usage with built-in RPC providers.
  - **Desktop wallets**: local apps that connect to nodes/RPC.
  - **Hosted (custodial) wallets** on exchanges: the provider controls keys (not recommended for self-custody).

- **Security implications**
  - Since they’re online, hot wallets are more exposed to **phishing**, **malicious extensions**, **device malware**, and **social engineering**.
  - Best practice is to keep **small, spending balances** in a hot wallet and store long-term holdings in cold storage or with stronger key controls.

## On Sei Network

Hot wallets on **Sei Network** are used to sign and submit transactions to Sei’s high-performance Layer 1. Sei supports **EVM compatibility**, so many Ethereum-style wallets and tooling patterns apply, including contract interactions via standard JSON-RPC calls and Solidity-based dApps.

Key points for hot wallets on Sei:

- **Fast user experience**
  - Sei’s ~**400ms finality** (typical) can make hot-wallet interactions—sending tokens or using dApps—feel near-instant compared to slower finality chains.
- **Parallelization**
  - Sei’s parallelized execution helps improve throughput, which can reduce congestion-related delays and improve responsiveness for wallet-driven activity during high demand.
- **EVM workflows**
  - If you’re using an EVM wallet to interact with Sei, transactions follow the familiar EVM flow: nonce management, gas parameters, and calldata encoding for contract calls.

### Example: Add Sei as a Network in an EVM Wallet (Conceptual)

Many EVM wallets allow adding a custom network through standard EIP-3085-style parameters. Use Sei’s official docs for the exact RPC URL, chain ID, and block explorer.

```typescript
// Example for an EVM wallet in the browser (e.g., injected provider)
await window.ethereum.request({
  method: 'wallet_addEthereumChain',
  params: [
    {
      chainId: '0x....', // Sei EVM chain ID in hex (see Sei docs)
      chainName: 'Sei',
      nativeCurrency: {
        name: 'SEI',
        symbol: 'SEI',
        decimals: 18
      },
      rpcUrls: ['https://<sei-evm-rpc>'],
      blockExplorerUrls: ['https://<sei-explorer>']
    }
  ]
});
```

### Example: Send a Transaction on Sei (EVM)

```typescript
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider('https://<sei-evm-rpc>');
const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY!, provider);

const tx = await wallet.sendTransaction({
  to: '0xRecipientAddress...',
  value: ethers.parseEther('0.01')
});

console.log('tx hash:', tx.hash);
console.log('receipt:', await tx.wait());
```

### Example: Basic Solidity Contract Interaction

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

contract Counter {
    uint256 public count;

    function inc() external {
        count += 1;
    }
}
```

A hot wallet signs the `inc()` call and submits it to Sei’s EVM RPC; Sei’s fast finality means the updated `count` is typically reflected quickly in the UI after confirmation.

## Pros and Cons

**Pros**

- Fast, convenient access to funds and dApps
- Seamless dApp interactions (especially on EVM chains like Sei)
- Great for daily transactions, trading, and on-chain apps

**Cons**

- Higher exposure to online threats
- Risk from compromised devices, browser extensions, or phishing
- Custodial hot wallets add counterparty risk (provider holds keys)

## Best Practices

- Keep only spending funds in a hot wallet; store long-term assets in cold storage.
- Verify URLs and contract addresses; avoid signing unknown messages.
- Use strong device security (OS updates, anti-malware, screen lock).
- Prefer hardware-wallet integration when available for added protection.
- Review transaction details (recipient, amount, network, gas) before signing.
