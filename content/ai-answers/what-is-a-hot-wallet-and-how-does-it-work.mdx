# What is a Hot Wallet and How Does It Work?

## Overview

A **hot wallet** is a cryptocurrency wallet that is **connected to the internet**, making it easy to send, receive, and manage digital assets quickly. In simple terms, when people ask **“what is hot wallet”**, they’re referring to a wallet designed for **convenience and frequent transactions**, typically at the cost of increased exposure to online threats compared to offline (“cold”) storage.

Hot wallets are commonly used for day-to-day activity like swapping tokens, interacting with dApps, minting NFTs, and staking—especially on fast networks where users benefit from quick confirmations.

## How It Works

Hot wallets manage **private keys** (or a seed phrase that derives them) that authorize transactions on a blockchain:

- **Key generation & storage:** When you create a hot wallet, it generates a seed phrase/private keys and stores them on an internet-connected device (phone, browser, or server).
- **Signing transactions:** To move funds, the wallet creates and **cryptographically signs** a transaction using the private key. The signed transaction is then broadcast to the network.
- **Address & balances:** The wallet shows your public address and reads balances by querying blockchain nodes or RPC endpoints—funds remain on-chain, not “inside” the wallet.
- **Security model:** Because it’s online, a hot wallet can be exposed to phishing, malware, compromised devices, malicious browser extensions, or leaked seed phrases.

### Common Types of Hot Wallets

- **Mobile wallets:** Apps that store keys on a smartphone.
- **Browser extension wallets:** Wallets integrated into the browser for dApp access.
- **Web wallets / hosted wallets:** Keys may be held by a service provider (custodial) or encrypted client-side (non-custodial).
- **Server wallets:** Programmatic wallets used by exchanges or apps—highly sensitive and must be secured with strong operational controls.

### Hot Wallet vs. Cold Wallet (Quick Comparison)

- **Hot wallet:** Best for speed and frequent use; higher online risk.
- **Cold wallet (hardware/air-gapped):** Best for long-term storage; slower but much more resistant to remote attacks.

## On Sei Network

Hot wallets are especially useful on **Sei Network**, a high-performance Layer 1 designed for low latency and high throughput. Sei’s features make interactive usage (trading, DeFi, gaming) smoother for hot-wallet users:

- **Fast user experience:** Sei offers **~400ms finality**, so transactions initiated from a hot wallet can confirm quickly—ideal for active DeFi and real-time apps.
- **Parallelization:** Sei’s architecture supports **parallel execution**, improving throughput and reducing congestion—helpful when many users are signing and broadcasting transactions at the same time.
- **EVM compatibility:** Sei supports **EVM-compatible smart contracts**, so popular Ethereum-style wallets and tooling patterns can apply, and Solidity contracts behave in familiar ways.

### Using a Hot Wallet with Sei (EVM) via JSON-RPC

Below is an example using `ethers` to connect a hot wallet (private key) to Sei’s EVM and send a transaction. Replace the RPC URL and chain parameters with Sei’s current EVM network details from official docs.

```typescript
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

// 1) Connect to Sei EVM RPC
const RPC_URL = process.env.SEI_EVM_RPC_URL!;
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(RPC_URL);

// 2) Load hot wallet from private key (store securely in env vars)
const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY!, provider);

async function main() {
  // 3) Build and send a simple native token transfer
  const tx = await wallet.sendTransaction({
    to: '0xRecipientAddressHere...',
    value: ethers.parseEther('0.01')
  });

  console.log('tx hash:', tx.hash);

  // 4) Wait for confirmation (Sei finality is fast)
  const receipt = await tx.wait();
  console.log('confirmed in block:', receipt?.blockNumber);
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

## Security Best Practices (Hot Wallet)

- **Never share your seed phrase**; no legitimate app or support agent will ask for it.
- Use a **hardware wallet** for large balances; keep a hot wallet for “spending money.”
- Enable **device security** (OS updates, screen lock, malware protection).
- Watch for **phishing**: verify URLs, avoid unknown links, and double-check dApp permissions.
- Use **separate wallets**: one for daily dApp usage, one for savings.
- Store keys in **secure environments** (avoid copying into notes/screenshots); for apps, prefer secure enclaves where available.

## Summary

A hot wallet is an internet-connected crypto wallet that makes it easy to sign transactions and interact with blockchains, trading convenience for greater online exposure. On **Sei Network**, hot wallets pair well with **~400ms finality**, **parallelization**, and **EVM compatibility**, enabling fast, responsive on-chain activity for everyday users and dApp interactions.
