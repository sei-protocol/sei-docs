## Overview

A **whale** is an individual, institution, or wallet address that holds a **very large amount of a cryptocurrency or token** relative to a project’s circulating supply or typical market participants. Whales can influence markets because their trades and on-chain actions may significantly affect **price, liquidity, and network activity**.

## How It Works

### Why whales matter

Whales matter primarily due to **concentration of capital**. When a single entity controls a large share of a token’s supply, their actions can move markets more than typical traders.

Common impacts include:

- **Price movement:** Large buys can push prices up; large sells can cause sharp drops.
- **Liquidity shifts:** Big swaps on AMMs can create **slippage** and temporarily distort pricing.
- **Order book pressure:** On exchanges, large limit orders can act as visible “walls” that influence trader behavior.
- **Governance influence:** In token-based governance, whales may have outsized voting power if voting is proportional to holdings or delegated stake.
- **Network signals:** Large transfers to exchanges can be interpreted as potential sell pressure; withdrawals can signal accumulation.

### Typical whale behaviors

Whales commonly use strategies to reduce market impact and improve execution:

- **Order splitting (TWAP/VWAP):** Breaking a large trade into smaller trades over time.
- **OTC deals:** Trading privately to avoid moving public markets.
- **Liquidity provision:** Depositing into AMMs or lending markets to earn yield (and potentially influence available liquidity).
- **Staking / delegation:** Earning staking rewards and influencing validator selection or governance outcomes.
- **Cross-chain moves:** Bridging assets to access different liquidity venues or ecosystems.

### Identifying whales (general approaches)

There is no universal on-chain label for a whale, but analysts typically use:

- **Wallet balance thresholds** (e.g., top 0.1% of holders)
- **Share of circulating supply**
- **Transaction size and frequency**
- **Exchange inflow/outflow patterns**
- **Clustering heuristics** (to identify related addresses—imperfect and not definitive)

## On Sei Network

On Sei Network, whale behavior is observed similarly—through **large balances and high-value transactions**—but the network’s architecture changes how these actions play out:

- **High throughput via parallelization:** Sei’s parallelized execution enables many transactions to be processed concurrently. Even when whales submit bursts of transactions (e.g., multiple swaps or transfers), the network is designed to handle high activity without the same level of congestion typical on slower chains.
- **Fast finality (~400ms):** Whale-driven events—such as large buys, sells, or liquidity moves—reach finality quickly, meaning market participants and bots can react with less uncertainty about reorgs or delayed confirmation.
- **EVM compatibility:** Whales can use standard Ethereum tooling and smart contracts (e.g., MEV-aware routers, multisigs, vaults) on Sei’s EVM environment, making it straightforward to deploy familiar trading and treasury-management strategies.

### Practical implications on Sei

- **Large swaps and liquidity moves can finalize quickly**, which may compress reaction times for arbitrageurs and market makers.
- **High activity periods are less likely to stall the chain**, but individual trades can still experience slippage based on pool depth and market conditions.
- **Monitoring whales remains valuable** for understanding liquidity shifts, governance power, and potential market volatility—especially in smaller-cap tokens where supply is more concentrated.

## Examples

### Check whether an address is a “whale” by comparing its balance to total supply (Solidity)

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

interface IERC20 {
    function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256);
    function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256);
}

contract WhaleCheck {
    // Returns true if holder owns >= thresholdBps (basis points) of total supply
    function isWhale(address token, address holder, uint256 thresholdBps)
        external
        view
        returns (bool)
    {
        require(thresholdBps <= 10_000, "bps > 100%");
        uint256 bal = IERC20(token).balanceOf(holder);
        uint256 supply = IERC20(token).totalSupply();
        if (supply == 0) return false;
        return (bal * 10_000) / supply >= thresholdBps;
    }
}
```

### Query an address balance using EVM JSON-RPC (bash)

```bash
# Replace RPC_URL and ADDRESS
curl -s $RPC_URL \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "method":"eth_getBalance",
    "params":["0xADDRESS","latest"],
    "id":1
  }'
```

### Get an ERC-20 token balance via `eth_call` (bash)

```bash
# balanceOf(address) selector = 0x70a08231
# Replace TOKEN, HOLDER, and RPC_URL
HOLDER_PADDED=$(python - <<'PY'
addr="0xHOLDER".lower().replace("0x","")
print(addr.rjust(64,"0"))
PY
)

curl -s $RPC_URL \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data "{
    \"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",
    \"method\":\"eth_call\",
    \"params\":[
      {\"to\":\"0xTOKEN\",\"data\":\"0x70a08231$HOLDER_PADDED\"},
      \"latest\"
    ],
    \"id\":1
  }"
```

## Key Takeaways

- A whale is a holder with enough assets to **materially impact** a token’s market dynamics or governance.
- Whale activity affects **price, liquidity, and sentiment**, and is often tracked using on-chain data and exchange flows.
- On Sei, whales operate in an environment optimized for **parallel execution**, **~400ms finality**, and **EVM-compatible** tooling—making large, time-sensitive actions confirm quickly and reliably.
