# What is Blockchain and How Does It Work?

## Overview

Blockchain is a shared, tamper-resistant digital ledger that records transactions and data across a network of computers rather than a single centralized database. Instead of trusting one administrator, participants rely on cryptography and a consensus mechanism to agree on the ledger’s state. In short, **what is blockchain**: a way to coordinate and verify data among many parties with strong integrity guarantees.

## How It Works

### Blocks, Transactions, and Hashes

A blockchain groups data (most commonly transactions) into **blocks**. Each block typically contains:

- A list of transactions (or state changes)
- A timestamp and metadata
- A **cryptographic hash** of its contents
- The **previous block’s hash**, linking blocks together

Because each block references the prior block, altering historical data changes the hash and breaks the chain, making tampering obvious and extremely difficult.

### Distributed Network (Nodes)

A blockchain runs on a peer-to-peer network of **nodes** that:

- Receive and broadcast transactions
- Validate rules (e.g., signatures, balances, smart contract logic)
- Store and synchronize the ledger

Some nodes also produce blocks (often called validators/miners, depending on the chain).

### Consensus: Agreeing on One History

Since many nodes may see transactions in different orders, blockchains use **consensus algorithms** to agree on a single canonical chain. Common approaches include:

- **Proof of Work (PoW):** miners solve computational puzzles (e.g., Bitcoin)
- **Proof of Stake (PoS):** validators stake tokens and are selected to propose/attest blocks

Consensus prevents double-spending and ensures the network converges on one shared ledger state.

### Cryptographic Signatures and Ownership

Users control accounts with private keys. Transactions are authorized via **digital signatures**, which nodes verify using the corresponding public key. This enables permissionless participation without a central identity provider.

### Smart Contracts and State

Many modern blockchains (e.g., Ethereum-compatible chains) support **smart contracts**—programs stored on-chain that execute deterministically. The blockchain maintains a global **state** (balances, contract storage, etc.), updated by each block.

## On Sei Network

Sei is a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain designed for fast finality and scalable execution while supporting **EVM compatibility**, making it straightforward to deploy Ethereum-style smart contracts. Key characteristics include:

- **Parallelization:** Sei is built to execute workloads efficiently by leveraging parallel processing where possible, improving throughput under real-world demand.
- **~400ms finality:** Transactions can reach finality in roughly hundreds of milliseconds, enabling low-latency applications such as trading, gaming, and real-time payments.
- **EVM compatibility:** Developers can use familiar Ethereum tooling (Solidity, Hardhat/Foundry, ethers.js/web3.js) to build and deploy contracts to Sei’s EVM environment.

Practically, this means the core idea of **what is blockchain**—a shared ledger maintained by consensus—applies on Sei as well, but with an emphasis on speed, parallel execution, and compatibility with the Ethereum developer ecosystem.

## Example: A Simple Smart Contract (EVM)

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

contract Counter {
    uint256 public value;

    function increment() external {
        value += 1;
    }
}
```

## Example: Deploying with Hardhat (Conceptual)

```bash
# install dependencies
npm i --save-dev hardhat @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox

# compile
npx hardhat compile

# deploy (requires setting a Sei EVM RPC URL and funded deployer key)
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network sei
```

## Why Blockchain Matters

- **Integrity:** Data is hard to alter retroactively due to hashing + consensus.
- **Transparency and auditability:** Ledgers can be publicly verifiable (depending on the chain).
- **Reduced reliance on intermediaries:** Rules can be enforced by code (smart contracts).
- **Programmable value:** Smart contracts enable DeFi, NFTs, on-chain games, and more.

## Key Terms (Glossary)

- **Block:** A batch of transactions/state changes added to the chain.
- **Hash:** A cryptographic fingerprint of data; small changes produce a completely different output.
- **Node:** A computer participating in the network by relaying/verifying data.
- **Validator:** A node that helps produce/confirm blocks under the consensus rules.
- **Finality:** The point at which a transaction is considered irreversible (Sei targets ~400ms finality).
- **Smart contract:** On-chain program that executes deterministically and updates state.
