## Overview

Gas fees are transaction execution costs paid to the network to process and finalize actions on a blockchain, such as sending tokens or calling a smart contract. They compensate validators for compute, storage, and bandwidth usage, and they help prevent spam by making excessive usage expensive.

## How It Works

### Gas, gas limit, and gas price

Most smart-contract blockchains meter work in **gas units**:

- **Gas used**: the actual amount of computational work and state changes your transaction performs.
- **Gas limit**: the maximum gas you allow the transaction to consume (a safety cap).
- **Gas price**: how much you’re willing to pay per unit of gas (denominated in the chain’s native token).

A simplified cost formula is:

```
total fee ≈ gas_used × gas_price (+ optional priority tip)
```

If a transaction runs out of gas (i.e., it needs more gas than your gas limit), it typically **reverts**. Depending on the chain, you may still pay for the work performed up to the point of failure.

### Why gas fees change

Gas fees rise and fall based on:

- **Network demand (congestion)**: more competing transactions increases the price users pay to be included quickly.
- **Transaction complexity**: swapping on a DEX or minting an NFT usually consumes more gas than a simple transfer.
- **Block capacity and fee market rules**: different chains use different mechanisms (e.g., EIP-1559-style base fee + tip, or first-price auctions).

### Who receives gas fees

Gas fees are generally distributed to:

- **Validators** (and their delegators) as rewards for including and executing transactions.
- In some fee models, a portion may be **burned** or routed to protocol-level funds.

## On Sei Network

Sei is a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain with **EVM compatibility**, enabling Solidity smart contracts and familiar Ethereum tooling while benefiting from Sei’s performance characteristics like **parallelization** and **~400ms finality**.

### Fee mechanics on Sei

On Sei:

- Users pay fees in Sei’s native token for transaction execution and resource usage.
- For EVM transactions, the experience is similar to Ethereum: transactions specify gas-related fields (e.g., gas limit and fee parameters), and the EVM meters execution using gas.
- Sei’s **parallelized execution** is designed to improve throughput by executing non-conflicting transactions concurrently, which can help reduce congestion-driven fee spikes in high-activity periods.
- With **fast finality (~400ms)**, transactions can reach finality quickly once included, improving UX for applications that depend on rapid confirmation.

### EVM example: estimating gas before sending a transaction

Below is a TypeScript example using `ethers` to estimate gas for an EVM contract call and submit the transaction.

```typescript
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

const RPC_URL = process.env.RPC_URL!; // Sei EVM RPC endpoint
const PRIVATE_KEY = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY!;

const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(RPC_URL);
const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(PRIVATE_KEY, provider);

const abi = ['function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) returns (bool)'];

async function main() {
  const tokenAddress = '0xYourTokenContract';
  const to = '0xRecipientAddress';
  const amount = ethers.parseUnits('1.0', 18);

  const token = new ethers.Contract(tokenAddress, abi, wallet);

  // Estimate gas for the call
  const gasEstimate = await token.transfer.estimateGas(to, amount);

  // Optionally set a buffer (e.g., +20%)
  const gasLimit = (gasEstimate * 120n) / 100n;

  // Send transaction (fee fields may be filled by the wallet/provider)
  const tx = await token.transfer(to, amount, { gasLimit });

  console.log('tx hash:', tx.hash);
  const receipt = await tx.wait();
  console.log('status:', receipt?.status);
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

### Practical tips to reduce gas costs

- **Batch operations** when possible (one transaction can be cheaper than many).
- **Avoid unnecessary storage writes** in smart contracts (storage is typically expensive).
- **Estimate gas** and set a reasonable gas limit; too low can fail, too high can lock up more funds temporarily (depending on the client behavior).
- For dApps, leverage Sei’s **fast finality** and **parallel execution** by designing flows that minimize conflicting state writes, improving throughput and helping maintain predictable fees.
