# Wallets and Wallet Providers

Wallets are essential for managing assets and interacting with the Sei
blockchain. There are various types of wallets available, each offering
different features and levels of security.

## Types of Wallets

1. **Software Wallets**: These are applications or browser extensions that
   manage private keys and interact with the blockchain. They are easy to use
   and accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.
2. **Hardware Wallets**: These are physical devices that securely store private
   keys offline. They provide enhanced security but are less convenient for
   frequent transactions.
3. **Passkey-based Wallets**: These wallets use passkeys for authentication
   instead of traditional seed phrases, offering an additional layer of
   security.
