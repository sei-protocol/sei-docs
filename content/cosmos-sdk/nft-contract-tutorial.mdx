# NFT Contract Tutorial

## Introduction

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are unique digital assets, each possessing distinct
identities and attributes. Unlike fungible tokens created by the Token Factory,
NFTs cannot be exchanged on a like-for-like basis.

<Nfts />

This tutorial guides you through the creation and deployment of an NFT contract
on Sei. By the end, you'll have deployed your own NFT contract. Select one of
the tabs below to get started!

## Deploying a CW721 Contract

In this section, we'll be deploying a CW721 contract, a standard for NFTs in the
CosmWasm ecosystem. For more about CW721, visit
[here](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-nfts/blob/main/packages/cw721/README.md).

### Requirements

Before starting, ensure you have:

- **`seid` CLI**: The Sei command-line interface tool, for interacting with the
  blockchain.
- **Wallet with SEI tokens on devnet**: Contains SEI tokens for transaction
  fees.
- **Rust Programming Environment**: Install Rust for CosmWasm contract
  development. Installation guide
  [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
- **Understanding of CosmWasm**: Familiarize yourself with CosmWasm smart
  contracts. Start with the [CosmWasm Book](https://book.cosmwasm.com/).
- **Docker**: Required for using the CosmWasm Rust Optimizer tool. Install from
  [Docker's official website](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

### Setting Up Your Environment

To work with CosmWasm smart contracts, you'll need the Wasm rust compiler
installed to build Wasm binaries. To install it, run:

```bash copy
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

Next, clone the `CW721-base` contract from the
[cw-nfts](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-nfts) repository:

```bash copy
git clone https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-nfts.git
cd cw-nfts/contracts/cw721-base
```

To test your setup, run:

```bash copy
cargo test
```

You should see that everything in the repository gets compiled and all tests
pass.

### Customizing the Contract

Review and modify the `cw721-base` contract to meet your requirements. This
might include updating metadata structures or changing the minting process.

### Build the Contract

To build the contract, run:

```bash copy
cargo wasm
```

This compiles a Wasm binary for uploading to Sei.

<Callout type="info">Note: The generated Wasm file will be located in the root directory of the `cw-nfts` repository, not in the `cw721-base` subdirectory. Make sure to navigate to the root directory to see your compiled `.wasm` file in `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/`.</Callout>

Before we can upload the contract to the chain, we have to use the
[CosmWasm Rust Optimizer](https://github.com/CosmWasm/rust-optimizer) to reduce
the contract size. While not required, this is highly recommended for live
contracts.

```bash copy
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/code \
  --mount type=volume,source="$(basename "$(pwd)")_cache",target=/target \
  --mount type=volume,source=registry_cache,target=/usr/local/cargo/registry \
  cosmwasm/optimizer:0.15.0 ./contracts/cw721-base/
```

This will generate an optimized Wasm contract in `/artifacts`.

<Callout type="warning">If you're using a Mac M1 machine, you might need to use the Arm 64-bit optimizer. However, it's important to note that the native Arm version generates wasm artifacts that differ from those produced by the Intel version. For production environments, we strongly recommend building contracts with the Intel optimizers to ensure reliability. Learn more [here](https://github.com/CosmWasm/rust-optimizer).</Callout>

### Deploy the Contract

Upload your contract:

```bash copy
seid tx wasm store artifacts/cw721_base.wasm --from=$ACCOUNT --chain-id=arctic-1 --node=https://rpc.arctic-1.seinetwork.io/ --broadcast-mode=block --gas=5000000 --fees=500000usei
```

Replace `$ACCOUNT` with your account name or address. This command stores the
contract on the chain and outputs a code ID.

<Callout type="info">For detailed descriptions of these arguments, use `seid help` in the CLI.</Callout>

Instantiate your contract using the code ID:

```bash copy
seid tx wasm instantiate $CONTRACT_CODE_ID '{"name":"$COLLECTION_NAME", "symbol":"$SYMBOL"}' --from=$ACCOUNT --admin=$ADMIN_ADDRESS --label=$LABEL --chain-id=arctic-1 --node=https://rpc.arctic-1.seinetwork.io/ --broadcast-mode=block --gas=250000 --fees=25000usei
```

Replace `$CONTRACT_CODE_ID`, `$ACCOUNT`, `$LABEL`, and `$ADMIN_ADDRESS`
appropriately. Successful instantiation will provide the NFT contract address.

- `$CONTRACT_CODE_ID`: Code ID of the uploaded contract (can be found in the
  output of the previous `store` command)
- `$COLLECTION_NAME`: Name of the collection
- `$SYMBOL`: Symbol of the collection
- `$ACCOUNT`: Your account name or address
- `$LABEL`: Any label for easy identification, can be used to look up the
  contract in future
- `$ADMIN_ADDRESS` (Optional): Address that will have administrative privileges
  over the contract, such as the ability to upgrade it

### Create Pointer Contract

To enable seamless use of this NFT contract in EVM environments, you can create
a pointer contract. This process results in an ERC721 token that can be imported
and used in EVM wallets and applications.

```bash copy
seid tx evm deploy-erccw721 $CW721_TOKEN_ADDRESS $NAME $SYMBOL --from=$SENDER --evm-rpc=https://evm-rpc.arctic-1.seinetwork.io/
```

**Parameters**

- `CW721_TOKEN_ADDRESS`: The contract address of the CW721 NFT you want to
  create an ERC721 pointer for.
- `NAME`: The name you want to assign to your ERC721 pointer token. This should
  match the name from the CW721 NFT.
- `SYMBOL`: The symbol for your ERC721 pointer token. This should match the
  symbol from the CW721 NFT.

**Flags**

- `--from`: The Sei address from which the deployment transaction is sent. This
  address must have enough balance to cover transaction fees.
- `--evm-rpc`: The endpoint URL for the EVM RPC interface of the Sei blockchain.
  This URL is used by the `seid` command to interact with the Sei EVM.

Executing this command creates an ERC721 NFT contract and outputs the contract
address. This NFT contract is linked to the CW721 NFT contract, meaning any
activities involving CW721 NFTs will also reflect on the state of the ERC721
NFTs and vice versa.
