# Token Standards

In this section, we delve into the various token standards supported on Sei.
Understanding these standards is crucial for developers as they form the
foundation of many decentralized applications.

Sei offers support for four main token types:

- [Sei Token](#sei-token)
- [Token Factory Tokens](#tokenfactory)
- [Smart Contract Tokens](#smart-contract-tokens)
- [IBC Tokens](#ibc-tokens)

## **Sei Token**

The Sei token is the native token of the Sei blockchain, serving multiple roles
within the ecosystem.

- **Fee Token**: Used to pay transaction fees on the Sei network.
- **Governance Token**: Used to participate in governance decisions affecting
  the network.

**EVM**

    `1sei = 10**18 wei =  1000000000000000000 wei`

    `1sei = 10**9 gwei = 1000000000 gwei` (giga-wei)

**Cosmos**

    `1sei = 10**18 asei = 1000000000000000000 asei` (atto-sei)

    `1sei = 10**9 nsei = 1000000000 nsei` (nano-sei)

    `1sei = 10**6 usei = 1000000 usei` (micro-sei)

    `1 gwei = 1 nsei`

## **Fungible Tokens**

Fungible tokens are digital assets that are interchangeable with one another and
are not unique. Sei supports both ERC20 and CW20 fungible token standards, so
developers have the option to create tokens using the TokenFactory module, or via
smart contract standards.

### Smart Contract Tokens

- **ERC20**: The ERC20 standard defines a common set of rules for fungible
  tokens on EVM-based blockchains. These tokens can be transferred, approved,
  and queried using standard functions.
- **Standard Compatibility**: Supporting both CW20 and ERC20 ensure
  compatibility with existing dApps and ecosystems while enabling onboarding of
  EVM-centric projects.
- **Interoperability**: Both standards support pointer contracts, enabling
  seamless interaction between Cosmos and EVM environments.
- **Interoperability and Pointer Contracts**:
  [Pointer contracts](/learn/pointers) enable interoperability
  between ERC20 and CW20 tokens, allowing for seamless interaction between the
  two standards. A registry is kept to track pointer contracts and facilitate
  interoperability.
- **Recommended Use**: Suitable for applications needing standard token
  interactions for use with existing dApps and maximum compatibility.

<Callout type="info">
**Interoperability:** Regardless of the choice, both TokenFactory and CW20/ERC20 tokens can have pointer contracts deployed, facilitating seamless cross-vm interoperability.

For more detailed guidance, refer to the
[Pointer Contracts Documentation](/learn/pointers).

## **NFTs**

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) represent unique digital assets. Sei supports both
ERC721 and CW721 standards as well as their counterparts with royalties (2981).

- **ERC721**: The ERC721 standard defines the structure for non-fungible tokens
  on EVM-based blockchains. Each token is unique and cannot be exchanged on a
  one-to-one basis like fungible tokens.
- **ERC2981**: These standards define royalty mechanisms for NFTs,
  ensuring creators receive a percentage of sales.
- **Interoperability**: Similar to fungible tokens, NFTs can interact across
  different standards using pointer contracts.
- **Pointer Contract Registry**: A registry for tracking pointer contracts
  specific to NFTs.

## **IBC Tokens**

Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) is a trust-less and permission-less interchain
messaging protocol that enables communication between many different chains. IBC
tokens are tokens bridged from one chain to another using the IBC protocol.
Channels are set up to establish communication between the chains. Each channel
has a unique identifier and specific configurations. View the
[IBC Channel](https://github.com/sei-protocol/chain-registry/blob/main/ibc_info.json)
section of the Sei chain registry for channel information.

### **Wrapped Sei (wSei)**

Some dApps may require Sei tokens to be wrapped in order to interact with them (similar to Wrapped ETH on Ethereum). The Wrapped Sei Token WSEI is deployed under the contract address [`0xE30feDd158A2e3b13e9badaeABaFc5516e95e8C7`](https://seitrace.com/token/0xE30feDd158A2e3b13e9badaeABaFc5516e95e8C7?chain=pacific-1).
