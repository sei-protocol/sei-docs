# Sei Giga

## Introduction

Sei Giga is a decentralized, permissionless Proof-of-Stake blockchain designed to address the persistent challenges of the "blockchain trilemma": the difficulty to simultaneously optimize for security, decentralization, and performance.

Through the Autobahn consensus protocol, Sei Giga achieves up to 5 gigagas throughput with sub-second finality while maintaining standard Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) security assumptions. This performance profile enables Sei Giga to support web2-scale usage on a verifiable and secure public ledger.

Sei Giga offers full EVM compatibility for standard smart contracts written in Solidity and Vyper with minimal modifications. The implementation maintains near-parity with Ethereum, with specific exceptions for EIP-4844, PREVRANDAO opcode behavior, state root mechanisms, block gas limits, and the Transaction Fee Mechanism (TFM).

## Architectural Foundations

Sei Giga's architecture rests on three key innovations that together enable its performance characteristics:

### 1. Asynchronous Execution Model

A fundamental design principle of Sei Giga is the separation of consensus and execution. Unlike traditional blockchains where these processes are tightly coupled, Sei Giga reaches consensus solely on the _ordering_ of transactions within a block, not the resulting state change.

This approach leverages a key property of deterministic execution:

**Lemma 1 (Deterministic Execution):** Given the same initial state ($S_{\text{init}}$) and the same ordered sequence of transactions $(t_{x_1}, t_{x_2}, ..., t_{x_n})$, all honest nodes executing these transactions will arrive at the exact same final state ($S_{\text{final}}$).

This property enables Sei Giga to decouple the ordering of transactions from their execution:

1. **Consensus:** Validators agree on transaction ordering in block $n$
2. **Finalization:** Block $n$ is finalized quickly
3. **Asynchronous Execution:** Execution nodes process the transactions from block $n$ in parallel with ongoing consensus for subsequent blocks
4. **State Commitment:** The resulting state root from executing block $n$ is committed in a later block ($n+x$)

This model prevents computation-heavy blocks from delaying the consensus process. The chain maintains consistent forward progress even during periods of high computational demand.

The execution process is fully pipelined with parallel parsing, address recovery, and signature verification. Sei Giga also uses a flat encoding format for transactions: a length-prefixed layout that avoids nested structures, enables fast, single-pass, zero-copy decoding, and reduces serialization overhead.

### 2. Autobahn Consensus Protocol

Sei Giga employs Autobahn, a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus protocol designed for high performance in the partial synchrony model. Autobahn addresses the limitations of traditional view-based protocols that struggle during network disruptions and DAG-based protocols that often show non-optimal latency.

The protocol operates under standard BFT assumptions:

- Network of $n = 3f + 1$ replicas (validators), tolerating up to $f$ Byzantine failures
- Secure point-to-point communication channels with unforgeable cryptographic signatures
- Safety guarantees hold unconditionally, while liveness requires eventual network synchrony

Autobahn's key innovation is its separation of data dissemination from ordering consensus through two complementary layers:

#### Data Dissemination Layer (Lanes)

Data dissemination occurs through independent lanes. Each replica $r$ maintains its own lane $\ell_r$ where it sequentially proposes batches of transactions $({\ell}_{r_0}, {\ell}_{r_1}, {\ell}_{r_2}, ...)$.

The proposal and certification process follows three steps:

1. **Propose:** Replica $r$ creates a data proposal $\text{Prop} = ⟨pos, B, parentRef⟩{}_r$ containing position, transaction batch, and a reference to the previous proposal
2. **Vote:** Replicas receiving a valid $\text{Vote}$ return a vote $\text{Vote} = ⟨\text{digest}(\text{Prop})⟩$
3. **Proof of Availability (PoA):** Once replica $r$ collects $f+1$ matching votes, it forms a PoA that certifies at least one correct replica can serve the proposal data

Since proposals within a lane are chained, referencing a tip (latest proposal with PoA) implicitly confirms the availability of all preceding proposals in that lane.

#### Consensus Layer (Cut of Tips)

The consensus layer periodically orders the latest certified tips from all lanes into a **Cut**, which creates a single globally ordered sequence of transaction batches. This happens through a two-phase BFT agreement protocol:

1. **Prepare:** The leader for the current slot collects the latest certified tips from all lanes, forms a $\text{Cut} = {\ell_1[\text{tip}], ..., \ell_n[\text{tip}]}$, and broadcasts it
2. **Commit (Fast Path):** If the leader receives $n$ prepare votes (from all replicas), the Cut is committed immediately
3. **Confirm (Slow Path):** If the leader receives at least $n-f=2f+1$ but fewer than $n$ votes, it enters a second "Confirm" phase

Autobahn also pipelines consensus slots. A replica can begin working on slot $s+1$ after seeing the Prepare message for slot $s$, without waiting for $s$ to be fully committed. This minimizes delays while maintaining safety through quorum intersection.

### 3. Parallel Execution Engine

Once a block's transaction order is finalized, Sei Giga executes transactions in parallel across multiple CPU cores using an Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC) mechanism inspired by Block-STM.

For a block containing transactions $t_1, t_2, ..., t_n$, where each transaction reads from a set $R_i$ and writes to a set $W_i$ of state variables:

- A dependency $t_j -> t_i$ exists if $j > i$ and $W_i$ intersects with $R_j ∪ W_j$

The parallel execution process follows four steps:

1. **Parallel Execution:** Transactions execute concurrently across multiple threads, each maintains private read/write sets
2. **Validation:** Each transaction validates that no already-committed transaction has modified its read/write sets
3. **Conflict Resolution:** If conflicts are detected, the transaction is rolled back and re-executed
4. **Commit:** Upon successful validation, changes are applied to the global EVM state

This approach ensures that transactions only commit once all dependencies are satisfied. It preserves execution semantics identical to a sequential model while dramatically improving performance on modern multi-core hardware.

Research has shown that approximately 64.85% of Ethereum transactions can be executed in parallel without conflicts. This makes the approach particularly effective for typical blockchain workloads.

## Storage Architecture

Sei Giga uses a specialized storage architecture that departs from traditional Merkle tree-based designs to optimize for high throughput and parallelism:

### Key Components

1. **Flat Key-Value Store:**

   - Global state stored in a Log-Structured Merge (LSM) tree implementation
   - Efficient for write-intensive workloads
   - Reduces structural overhead compared to Merkle trees
   - Simplifies concurrency control (locking individual keys vs. tree branches)

2. **Cryptographic Accumulators:**

   - Replace traditional Merkle paths with cryptographic accumulators
   - Provide compact proofs of membership/non-membership across many keys
   - Updates can be batched and performed asynchronously
   - Maintain verifiability without the overhead of frequent tree updates

3. **Tiered Storage:**

   - Hot Storage: Recent blocks and frequently accessed state on high-performance SSDs
   - Cold Storage: Historical data migrated to distributed, potentially columnar, database systems
   - Reduces hardware requirements for validators
   - Provides scalable solution for analytics and audits

4. **Write-Ahead Log (WAL):**
   - Append-only WAL for durability
   - Updates logged first, then applied to main state
   - Ensures data integrity and recovery after crashes

This hybrid approach significantly reduces I/O bottlenecks while maintaining strong cryptographic guarantees of state correctness and managing long-term data growth.

## Economic Model

Sei Giga's economic model centers on the native SEI token, with a total supply of 10 billion (10,000,000,000) SEI. The token serves multiple functions:

- **Gas and Transaction Fees:** Paying for execution and state usage
- **Staking:** Validators stake SEI to participate in consensus and secure the network
- **Rewards:** Compensating validators for participation

### Staking and Validation

- **Validators:** Run nodes that participate in consensus and execution
- **Delegators:** Stake their SEI with chosen validators
- **Bonding Period:** A 21-day unbonding period applies to both validators' self-stake and delegated stake
- **Rewards:** Block rewards are aggregated over epochs and distributed among eligible validators

### Slashing

Validators face penalties (loss of staked SEI) for misbehavior:

- **Liveness Failures:** Penalties for excessive downtime
- **Safety Violations:** More severe penalties for double-signing blocks
- Penalties increase for repeated offenses
