# Oracle Providers

Oracles are the bridge between blockchain networks and real-world data. They provide a secure mechanism for bringing off-chain price data on-chain, enabling DeFi protocols, smart contracts, and dApps to access reliable external information.

## Use Cases

- **DeFi Developers:** Query real-time prices and TWAPs for liquidations and trading
- **dApp Builders:** Access reliable price feeds for any on-chain application
- **Infrastructure Providers:** Build enhanced oracle services on top of existing solutions
