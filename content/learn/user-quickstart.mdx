# Get Started With Sei

This getting started guide will help you set up your wallet and start using Sei,
even if you're new to blockchain. By the end, you'll be ready to explore the
most performant blockchain ever.

## 1.) Get a Wallet

Download a compatible, wallet, such as [Compass](https://compasswallet.io/), [Rabby](https://rabby.io/), [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), or any other [supported wallet](/learn/wallets).

## 2.) Set Up and "Associate" Your Wallet

Simply making a transaction will broadcast your public key to the chain, allowing full cross-environemnt functionality.
If your wallet is not "associated" it simply means that the network is not aware that your key exists, and therefore it cannot be determined which two addresses are actually the same wallet due to the cryptographic algorithm by which the EVM wallet address is derived from the key(s).
