### I already have a Compass Wallet. How do I find my EVM / 0x address?

Simply open compass wallet and click the "Receive" button, and you will see both
your Sei and 0x (EVM) addresses available to copy. Both addresses point to the
same account.

### How can I link my EVM / 0x and Sei addresses?

You can use the [Sei App]() to link your addresses. More information and a step by
step guide is available in the
[Linking Addresses](./accounts) user guide.
