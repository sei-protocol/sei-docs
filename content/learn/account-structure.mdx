# **Sei Account Structure and Address Linking**

On Sei, accounts are represented by two address formats:

- **Sei native Bech32** (`sei...`)
- **EVM-compatible Hex** (`0x...`)

Both addresses for a single account are derived from the same **public key**,
but the chain can only determine their association **after the public key is
known**.

---

## **How Accounts Work on Sei**

### **Automatic Linking**

- When an account **broadcasts a transaction** (e.g., sending tokens), its
  public key is recorded on-chain.
- Once the public key is known, the **EVM address** and **Bech32 address** are
  linked automatically.
- This ensures balances and transactions are accessible across both address
  formats.

### **Manual Association**

If the account has not broadcasted any transaction yet:

- Use the `sei_associate` function to **manually record the public key**
  on-chain.
- This is a **gasless operation** as long as the account has **at least 1 wei**.

> **Why is the public key required?**  
> The public key enables the chain to derive and validate both the Bech32 and
> EVM addresses. Without it, the chain cannot determine the relationship between
> these two addresses.

---

## **Key Points**

### **Before Linking**

- The Bech32 (`sei...`) and EVM (`0x...`) addresses are treated as **separate
  accounts**.
- They will have separate balances until linked.
- Native tokens received by the EVM address prior to association will be held in
  a temporary native address, which will transfer to the associated address upon
  linking.
- Some types of transactions will **not be possible** (see table below).

### **After Linking**

- Balances are reflected consistently across both addresses.
- Applications can query either address format seamlessly.

---

## **Wallet Association and Transfer Limitations**

Certain actions are **not possible** before wallets are associated:

- Transfers of **CW-based tokens** (e.g., CW20/721/1155) from a non-EVM wallet
  to an **unassociated EVM address**.
- Transfers of **ERC-based tokens** (e.g., ERC20/721/1155) from an EVM wallet to
  an **unassociated Sei native address**.

## Query Linked Addresses

### Fetch EVM Address for a Sei Address

```bash copy
curl -X POST $SEIEVM -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d \
'{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "sei_getEVMAddress", "params": ["<seiAddress>"], "id": 1}'
```

**Example Response**:

```json copy
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": "0x4e1ae6017997128D421074FbE31d90362F181C"
}
```

**Failure Example**:

```json copy
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "error": {
    "code": -32000,
    "message": "failed to find EVM address for sei1wev8ptz..."
  }
}
```

### Fetch Bech32 Address for an EVM Address

```bash copy
curl -X POST $SEIEVM -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d \
'{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "sei_getSeiAddress", "params": ["<hexAddress>"], "id": 1}'
```

**Example Response**:

```json copy
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": "sei1wev8ptzj27aueu04wg..."
}
```

---

### Manual Association Using `sei_associate`

If no transaction has been broadcasted, use this command to manually associate
the addresses:

```bash copy
seid tx evm associate-address [optional priv key hex] --rpc=<url> --from=<sender> [flags]
```

> **Note**: The account must have at least 1 wei to perform this operation.

---

## **Deriving Addresses from the Public Key**

### **Sei Address Derivation**

The Sei native address is derived from the public key using the following steps:

1. Hash the public key using the `keccak256` algorithm.
2. Extract the first 20 bytes of the resulting hash.
3. Encode the extracted bytes in **Bech32 format** with the `sei` prefix.

Example implementation:

```ts copy
import { bech32 } from 'bech32';
import { keccak256 } from 'ethereumjs-util';

export function deriveSeiAddress(publicKey: Buffer): string {
  const hash = keccak256(publicKey);
  const words = bech32.toWords(hash.slice(0, 20));
  return bech32.encode('sei', words);
}
```

### **EVM Address Derivation**

The EVM-compatible address is derived as follows:

1. Hash the public key using the `keccak256` algorithm.
2. Extract the **last 20 bytes** of the resulting hash.
3. Prefix the extracted bytes with `0x` to obtain the EVM address.

Example implementation:

```ts copy
import { keccak256 } from 'ethereumjs-util';

export function deriveEVMAddress(publicKey: Buffer): string {
  const hash = keccak256(publicKey);
  return `0x${hash.slice(-20).toString('hex')}`;
}
```

### **Summary**

- **Public Key Hashing**: Both derivations rely on the `keccak256` hashing
  algorithm.
- **Sei Address**: Extract the **first 20 bytes** of the hash and encode it in
  **Bech32 format**.
- **EVM Address**: Extract the **last 20 bytes** of the hash and format it in
  **Hex** with a `0x` prefix.

### **Why It Works**

The `keccak256` hashing ensures a consistent and verifiable process for deriving
both address formats from the same public key. This enables a single account to
maintain compatibility across the Sei native and EVM environments.

---

## **Conclusion**

- Accounts are automatically linked when a transaction is broadcasted or can be
  manually associated using `sei_associate`.
- Both address formats share the same **public key**.
- Linking enables dApps and tools to access balances consistently across both
  address formats.
