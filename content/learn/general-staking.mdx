# Staking

Staking is a fundamental aspect of the Sei blockchain, enabling network security
and consensus through a delegated proof-of-stake (dPoS) mechanism. By
participating in staking, both validators and delegators play a critical role in
maintaining and securing the network, ensuring its long-term stability,
performance, and success. PoS chains rely on staked economic value rather than
computational power, leading to a more energy-efficient and scalable system.
Engaging in staking allows developers and users to contribute to the health and
growth of the Sei ecosystem and participate in [governance](/general-governance)
decisions by voting on proposals.

In a dPoS system, token holders secure the network by delegating their tokens to
validators. Validators produce new blocks and validate transactions. In return
for their support, delegators earn a portion of the staking rewards. A
validator's weight is based on the number of tokens delegated to them plus their
own stake.

The Sei protocol incentivizes validators and delegators with staking rewards
from gas fees and genesis token unlocks. ALl rewards are distributed
to delegators proportional to their delegation, and the validator keeps a percentage of this as commission.
Users can view a validator's commission rate on the Sei App, or by querying the validator information on-chain.

## How to Stake

Staking on Sei can be done through the Sei App, via the `seid` CLI, or even
through API calls.

- **Sei App**: [Staking](https://app.sei.io/stake)
- **seid CLI**: `seid tx staking [command] [flags]`
- **REST/RPC**: `GET/POST /staking/*`

## Key Concepts

### Delegation

Delegating tokens to a validator allows you to earn a portion of the staking
rewards. By delegating, you add to the validator's total stake, which helps
secure the network.

### Delegators

Delegators are users who stake their Sei tokens to a validator, contributing to
the validator's total stake. Delegators earn a portion of the transaction fees
as staking rewards. Staked Sei remains under the control of the delegator and
cannot be traded freely during the staking period.

### Un-delegation

Un-delegation is the process of withdrawing your staked tokens. This involves a
21-day un-bonding period during which the tokens are not earning rewards and
cannot be transferred. After the un-bonding period, the tokens are returned to
your wallet and are available for transactions.

### Re-delegation

Re-delegation allows you to move staked tokens from one validator to another
without undergoing the un-bonding period. When re-delegating, the tokens are
instantly moved, but the new validator is barred from further re-delegations for
21 days to ensure stability and prevent abuse. Each account can re-delegate a
maximum of 7 times simultaneously, with a re-delegation not considered complete
until the 21-day period is up.

### Bonding

Bonding is the process of committing your Sei tokens to a validator. This can be
done through delegation. The tokens are locked and contribute to the validator's
stake, starting to earn rewards immediately.

### Un-Bonding

Delegators can un-bond or un-stake their Sei tokens, initiating a 21-day period
during which the tokens do not earn rewards and cannot be transferred. After
this period, the tokens return to the delegator's wallet and become available
for transactions. Users can re-delegate to another validator instantly without
waiting for the un-bonding period to end.

### Jailing

To ensure network uptime and overall security, validators must meet strict standards and consistently participate in the consensus process.
Jailing can occur if these standards are not met. Jailed validators are excluded from
participating consensus for a period and will not generate rewards during this time.

<Callout type="info" title="Note">
  When a validator misbehaves and gets jailed, users can still perform all staking operations including claiming rewards, delegating, and undelegating from that validator. Note that misbehaviors are currently not penalized in the system, so there are no slashing consequences for validator misconduct.

### Slashing

There is no slashing of funds in Sei.

## Common Questions

### How are staking rewards calculated?

Staking rewards are calculated based on the total amount of Sei staked and the validator's performance. Rewards are distributed proportionally to the amount staked by each delegator.

For more details, see [Delegators](#delegators).

### Can I change my validator without un-bonding?

Yes, you can use the re-delegation feature to move your stake from one validator to another without waiting for the un-bonding period to end.

For more details, see [Re-delegation](#re-delegation).
