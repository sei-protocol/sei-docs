# MCP Server

The Sei Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server enables AI assistants to interact with the Sei networks through a natural language interface. Built on the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) standard, it provides seamless blockchain integration for AI agents, chat bots, and coding assistants like Cursor, Windsurf, and Claude.

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that connects AI systems with external tools and data sources. It allows AI assistants to:

- Access real-time data from external services
- Execute functions and operations
- Maintain context across interactions
- Provide specialized capabilities beyond their base training

The Sei MCP Server leverages this protocol to bring blockchain functionality directly to your AI assistant, enabling natural language interactions with the Sei network.

## Capabilities

The Sei MCP Server provides comprehensive blockchain functionality:

## Getting Your Private Key

<Callout type="warning">
**Security Warning**: Never share your private key or commit it to version control. Store it securely and only use it in trusted environments.

For this server, it is recommended that you generate a new private key specifically for your MCP Server. This will allow you to keep your main wallet private key separate and secure.

</Callout>

To perform blockchain transactions, you'll need to provide your accounts's private key:

Most wallets provide private key export in their security or account settings. Look for options like:

- "Export Private Key"
- "Show Private Key"
- "Account Details"
- "Security Settings"

## What You Can It Do

The Sei MCP Server enables your AI assistant to:

### üîç Read Documentation

Ask your AI assistant to explain Sei concepts, smart contract patterns, or development best practices directly from the official documentation.

### üîß Blockchain Operations

- Check account balances and transaction history
- Transfer tokens between addresses
- Interact with smart contracts
- Query blockchain data and network status

### üìö Understand @sei-js Libraries (Coming Soon)

Get explanations and examples for using Sei's JavaScript/TypeScript libraries, including code snippets and integration patterns.

### üöÄ Create Boilerplate Repositories (Coming Soon)

Generate starter projects, smart contract templates, and full-stack applications configured for Sei development.

### üí° More Coming Soon

We're continuously expanding the MCP Server's capabilities. Future updates will include:

- DeFi protocol integrations
- Advanced contract deployment tools
- Cross-chain bridge operations
- Enhanced development workflows

## Example Usage

Once configured, you can interact with your AI assistant using natural language:

```
You: "What's my SEI balance?"
AI: [Uses MCP Server to check your wallet balance]

You: "Send 1 SEI to 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b8D4C1C4e3153DC"
AI: [Executes the transfer and provides transaction details]

You: "Create a simple ERC20 token contract for Sei"
AI: [Generates a complete smart contract with deployment instructions]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Server not connecting**: Ensure you have Node.js 18+ installed and restart your AI assistant after configuration.

**Private key errors**: Verify your private key is correctly formatted (starts with `0x`) and has sufficient funds for gas fees.
