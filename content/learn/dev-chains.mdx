# Chains

Sei utilizes multiple chains for various stages of the development lifecycle.
This multi-chain approach allows developers to build, deploy, manage, and
iterate confidently, ensuring thorough testing and feedback before updates go
live on the mainnet.

> [!NOTE]
>
> All chain updates are first deployed to the devnet to ensure stability. They are then moved to the testnet for further testing and validation. Finally, the updates are released to the mainnet. This process allows developers to test their applications thoroughly and raise any concerns regarding the upgrades before they go live on the mainnet.

## Mainnet

Mainnet is the live, production environment where actual transactions and
smart contract deployments occur. This chain is used for all real-world
applications and activities.

- **Purpose**: Production
- **Chain ID**: `pacific-1`
- **EVM Chain ID**: `1329` or `0x531`

## Testnet

Testnet is used for testing and development purposes. Developers can
deploy and test their dApps and smart contracts in a controlled environment that
simulates the mainnet conditions. This chain is crucial for ensuring that
applications work as expected before going live.

- **Purpose**: Staging
- **Chain ID**: `atlantic-2`
- **EVM Chain ID**: `1328` or `0x530`

## Devnet

Devnet serves as a development network for early-stage testing and experimentation.
This chain is typically used by developers to test new features, perform
integration testing, and develop prototypes in an isolated environment.

- **Purpose**: Testing
- **Chain ID**: `arctic-1`
- **EVM Chain ID**: `713715` or `0xAE3F3`

## Local Chains

Developers can also run local chains on their machines for testing and
development purposes. Local chains are isolated environments that mimic the
behavior of the mainnet, testnet, or devnet chains. They are useful for testing
new features, debugging issues, and experimenting with smart contracts with full
control over all tokens and governance decisions.

- **Purpose**: Development
- **Chain ID**: Set by user (default: `sei-chain`)

Please read the [Nodes Introduction](/node) section for more
information on how to set up and run a local chain.
