# Pointer Contracts

Pointer Contracts enable tokens to be used interoperably in both EVM and
Cosmos environments. Intended to be efficient and quick to deploy, a pointer
simply serves as an interpreter between the two "languages" used in either
execution environment.

## Why Pointer Contracts

<ImageWithCaption img={PointerContractsWithout} alt="Without Pointer Contracts" caption="A world without pointer contracts" />

Wallets and clients for feature-rich protocols typically support only a single
execution environment. EVM wallets handle ERC-20 coins and ERC-721 NFTs but
cannot interact with Cosmos-SDK based assets due to different token standards and
interaction methods. The same problem exists for clients built for other
protocols (like Cosmos and its various SDK modules) which cannot directly interact with Ethereum-based contracts or ERC tokens.

Pointer Contracts solve this by enabling interoperability of either protocol,
regardless of the client interface.

## How Pointer Contracts Work

<ImageWithCaption img={HowItWorks} alt="How Pointer Contracts Work" caption="Pointer contracts enable seamless interoperability" />

Each smart contract is limited to **one** associated pointer contract, which
must be registered on chain when deploying. This prevents conflicts and provides
a reference point for verifying the authenticity of the paired contract itself.

## Deploying pointers

View each pointer contract's documentation for more details on how to deploy by choosing a pointer type you want to use.
