## What most users need to do

- If you use Keplr or Leap (Cosmos-style wallets) and hold assets on the native address (sei1...), you should move assets to an EVM-compatible address (0x...). Use the Asset Transfer tool linked below.
- If you use Compass or another EVM wallet already, you’re good — continue as normal.

## Key tools and resources

### 1) Asset Transfer (Native ↔ EVM)

- Use the official Sei App to move assets between native (Keplr/Leap/Fin) and EVM (MetaMask/Compass etc.) addresses: [Sei App Transfer](https://app.sei.io/evm-upgrade) or the Bridge tab at [Sei App Bridge](https://app.sei.io/bridge).
- Helpful how-to: [Move SEI between Native (Keplr) and EVM (MetaMask)](https://support.sei.io/hc/en-us/articles/35567228807195-How-Do-I-Move-SEI-Between-Native-Keplr-and-EVM-MetaMask).

When to use this:

- You used Keplr or Leap before and want assets available via an EVM wallet going forward.
- You need to access tokens on apps that now expect an EVM (0x) address.

### 2) Astroport recovery

If you previously provided liquidity or held positions in Astroport pools on Sei, use the Astroport recovery flow to withdraw residual funds.

- Astroport recovery entry: [Astroport](https://sei.astroport.fi)

### 3) USDC on Sei

Native USDC and Circle’s CCTP V2 are now supported on Sei. USDC from Noble is depricated.

## FAQ

### I am a Keplr / Leap wallet user; do I need to do anything?

Yes. Use the Asset Transfer tool to ensure your assets are available via an EVM wallet. See Asset Transfer above.

### I use Compass wallet; do I need to do anything?

No action needed. Compass ensures your assets are available via EVM. Continue connecting to Sei like any EVM chain.

### I previously provided liquidity in Astroport — how do I retrieve my funds?

Use Astroport’s recovery flow to withdraw funds still in pools. See Astroport recovery above.

### I stake SEI — do I need to do anything?

If you are already using an EVM-compatible wallet, nothing changes. If you previously staked using Keplr or Leap, you must unbond your stake and then migrate assets to an EVM wallet using the Asset Transfer tool.
