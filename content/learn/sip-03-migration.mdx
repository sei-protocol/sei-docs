# SIP-03 Migration

<Callout type="warning">

**Holders of USDC.n must swap or migrate before end of March 2026.**

If you hold [USDC.n](https://seitrace.com/token/0x3894085Ef7Ff0f0aeDf52E2A2704928d1Ec074F1) (USDC via Noble), you need to swap or migrate to native USDC before the SIP-3 upgrade (expected end of March 2026) to avoid losing access to your assets. After the upgrade, Sei will no longer support Cosmos-native assets like USDC.n.

For full details, steps, and timelines, see: [Holders of USDC.n Need to Swap or Migrate](https://blog.sei.io/announcements/holders-of-usdcn-need-to-swap-or-migrate/) and the instructions below.

This page consolidates the most important, practical actions for the SIP-03 migration and links to the official resources.

</Callout>

## What most users need to do

- If you use Keplr or Leap (Cosmos-style wallets) and hold assets on the native address (sei1...), you should move assets to an EVM-compatible address (0x...). Use the Asset Transfer tool linked below.
- If you use Compass or another EVM wallet already, you’re good — continue as normal.

## Key tools and resources

### 1) Asset Transfer (Native ↔ EVM)

- Use the official Sei App to move assets between native (Keplr/Leap/Fin) and EVM (MetaMask/Compass etc.) addresses: [Sei App Transfer](https://app.sei.io/evm-upgrade) or the Bridge tab at [Sei App Bridge](https://app.sei.io/bridge).

When to use this:

- You used Keplr or Leap before and want assets available via an EVM wallet going forward.
- You need to access tokens on apps that now expect an EVM (0x) address.

### 2) Astroport recovery

If you previously provided liquidity or held positions in Astroport pools on Sei, use the Astroport recovery flow to withdraw residual funds.

- Astroport recovery entry: [Astroport](https://sei.astroport.fi)

### 3) USDC on Sei

Native USDC and Circle's CCTP V2 are now supported on Sei. USDC from Noble (USDC.n) is deprecated.

- Background: [USDC & CCTP v2 announcement](https://www.circle.com/blog/native-usdc-and-cctp-v2-are-coming-to-sei)

#### How to swap or migrate USDC.n

**Swap (smaller amounts):**

- [DragonSwap](https://dragonswap.app/) or [Symphony](https://symph.ag/?tokenIn=0x3894085ef7ff0f0aedf52e2a2704928d1ec074f1&tokenOut=0xe15fc38f6d8c56af07bbcbe3baf5708a2bf42392) — slippage may vary depending on market conditions and liquidity.

**Migrate (larger amounts):**

- Use the [USDC Migration Tool](https://brrr.fun/tools?tab=usdc-migration) — this batches and migrates your USDC.n to native USDC via Noble → Polygon → Sei using Circle's CCTP.
- **Manual migration:** Bridge USDC.n via [Stargate](https://stargate.finance/) to an intermediary chain with CCTP v1 and v2 (e.g., Base), then use CCTP to burn/mint native USDC back to Sei.
- Other useful bridging frontends: [CCTP Exchange](https://cctp.exchange/)

**For DeFi suppliers of USDC.n (Yei, Takara Lend, etc.):**

- Wind down and withdraw your positions **before** migrating to native USDC. Failure to do so before the SIP-3 upgrade may result in inability to access your supplied assets.

## FAQ

### I am a Keplr / Leap wallet user; do I need to do anything?

Yes. Use the Asset Transfer tool to ensure your assets are available via an EVM wallet. See Asset Transfer above.

### I use Compass wallet; do I need to do anything?

No action needed. Compass ensures your assets are available via EVM. Continue connecting to Sei like any EVM chain.

### I previously provided liquidity in Astroport — how do I retrieve my funds?

Use Astroport’s recovery flow to withdraw funds still in pools. See Astroport recovery above.

### I stake SEI — do I need to do anything?

If you are already using an EVM-compatible wallet, nothing changes. If you previously staked using Keplr or Leap, you must unbond your stake and then migrate assets to an EVM wallet using the Asset Transfer tool.

### I hold USDC.n (USDC via Noble) — what should I do?

You must swap or migrate your USDC.n to native USDC before the SIP-3 upgrade (expected end of March 2026). After the upgrade, USDC.n may become inaccessible or lose its value on Sei. See the [USDC on Sei](#3-usdc-on-sei) section above for swap and migration options, or read the full announcement: [Holders of USDC.n Need to Swap or Migrate](https://blog.sei.io/announcements/holders-of-usdcn-need-to-swap-or-migrate/).
