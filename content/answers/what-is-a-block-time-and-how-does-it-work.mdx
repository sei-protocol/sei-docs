# What is a Block Time and How Does It Work?

## Overview

Block time is the average time it takes a blockchain network to produce a new block of transactions and add it to the chain. In simple terms, it’s the cadence of the network: how frequently transactions are bundled, proposed, and confirmed on-chain. When people ask **“what is block time”**, they’re usually trying to understand how quickly a network can include transactions and how responsive it feels for users.

## How It Works

### What “block time” measures

- **Time between blocks:** Typically measured as an average over many blocks (because block production can vary).
- **Transaction inclusion speed:** Shorter block times often mean transactions can be _included_ sooner, though “final confirmation” depends on the consensus model.
- **Network throughput and UX:** Faster block times can improve user experience (faster updates), but may increase network overhead if blocks are too frequent.

### What determines block time

Block time is an emergent result of protocol design and network conditions, including:

- **Consensus mechanism:** Proof-of-Work (PoW), Proof-of-Stake (PoS), and BFT-style consensus each have different timing and finality characteristics.
- **Block proposal/validation steps:** The time for proposing a block, propagating it through the network, and validating it.
- **Network latency and bandwidth:** Higher latency can force longer target block times to reduce fork/reorg risk.
- **Validator/miner behavior:** Availability, performance, and configuration can influence stability around the target.

### Block time vs. finality (important distinction)

Block time is **not always the same as finality**.

- **Block time**: how often new blocks are produced.
- **Finality**: when a transaction is considered irreversible (or extremely unlikely to be reverted).

Some networks have _probabilistic finality_ (often requiring multiple confirmations), while others have _fast deterministic finality_ where a block becomes final quickly after it’s produced.

### Why block time matters

- **User experience:** Shorter block times usually mean faster feedback (e.g., balances updating sooner).
- **Trading and DeFi:** Lower latency can improve execution and reduce stale pricing windows.
- **Security and reorg risk:** Very short block times can increase the chance of competing blocks if propagation can’t keep up.
- **Infrastructure load:** More blocks per hour increases indexing, storage, and networking work.

## On Sei Network

Sei is designed for high performance and low-latency transaction confirmation. While “block time” is often used as a general term, Sei’s user-facing experience is better captured by its **fast finality (~400ms)** and its ability to process many transactions concurrently.

### Sei’s fast finality and responsiveness

- **~400ms finality:** Transactions can reach finality in around 400 milliseconds, enabling near real-time experiences for trading, gaming, and consumer apps.
- **Practical impact:** Users see confirmations quickly, and developers can build apps that rely on rapid, deterministic outcomes.

### Parallelization: scaling without waiting for a single sequential pipeline

Sei’s architecture emphasizes **parallelization**, allowing the network to execute many independent transactions concurrently (when they don’t conflict on state). This improves throughput and helps maintain low latency under load—meaning the network can stay responsive even when activity spikes.

### EVM compatibility: familiar tooling with fast confirmation

Sei supports **EVM compatibility**, so smart contract developers can use common Ethereum tools (Solidity, Hardhat/Foundry-style flows, Ethers.js/Web3.js patterns) while benefiting from Sei’s performance characteristics.

### Developer example: measuring “block time” via block timestamps (EVM)

On EVM chains, a common way to _approximate_ block time is to sample timestamps from consecutive blocks. This measures “time between blocks” from the perspective of the node you query.

```typescript
import { JsonRpcProvider } from 'ethers';

async function estimateBlockTime(rpcUrl: string, sample: number = 200) {
  const provider = new JsonRpcProvider(rpcUrl);

  const latest = await provider.getBlock('latest');
  const past = await provider.getBlock(latest.number - sample);

  const seconds = latest.timestamp - past.timestamp;
  return seconds / sample;
}

(async () => {
  const rpcUrl = process.env.RPC_URL!;
  const avg = await estimateBlockTime(rpcUrl, 200);
  console.log(`Estimated average block time: ~${avg.toFixed(2)}s`);
})();
```

**Notes:**

- Block timestamps can vary based on protocol rules and validator behavior, so this is an estimate.
- For user experience on Sei, **finality (~400ms)** is often the more meaningful metric than average time-between-blocks.

### Contract example: reading the current block timestamp

Smart contracts can’t directly read “block time,” but they can use block metadata such as `block.timestamp` and `block.number`.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

contract BlockMetadata {
    function getBlockInfo() external view returns (uint256 number, uint256 timestamp) {
        return (block.number, block.timestamp);
    }
}
```

## Key Takeaways

- **What is block time?** It’s the average interval between newly produced blocks on a blockchain.
- Block time influences **transaction inclusion speed**, but **finality** determines when a transaction is truly irreversible.
- On **Sei Network**, developers and users benefit from **~400ms finality**, **parallelized execution**, and **EVM compatibility**, enabling fast, scalable on-chain applications.
