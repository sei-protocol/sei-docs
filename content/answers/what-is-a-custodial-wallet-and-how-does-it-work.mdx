# What is a Custodial Wallet and How Does It Work?

## Overview

A **custodial wallet** is a crypto wallet where a third party (such as an exchange or wallet provider) holds and manages your private keys on your behalf. In practice, this means the custodian can sign transactions for you, and you access your funds through an account, password, and often additional security controls like 2FA.

If you’re searching **“what is custodial wallet”**, the simplest answer is: it’s a wallet where you don’t directly control the private keys—another entity does.

## How It Works

In blockchain systems, ownership of assets is controlled by **private keys**, which are used to sign transactions. A custodial wallet changes the typical “self-custody” model by shifting key management and transaction signing to a service provider.

### Key components

- **Private key custody**: The provider stores private keys (often in HSMs, cold storage, or multi-signature setups).
- **User account access**: You log into an app or exchange to view balances and request transfers.
- **Transaction signing**: When you initiate a send, the custodian signs and broadcasts the transaction to the network.
- **Internal ledgers** (common): Many custodians keep an internal database of user balances and only settle on-chain when needed (e.g., withdrawals).

### Typical transaction flow

1. **Deposit**: You send tokens to a deposit address managed by the custodian (or assigned to your account).
2. **Balance update**: Your account balance is credited (sometimes after on-chain confirmations).
3. **Transfer within platform**: Moves may occur off-chain inside the custodian’s internal ledger.
4. **Withdraw**: You request a withdrawal to an external address; the custodian signs an on-chain transaction and broadcasts it.

### Custodial vs. non-custodial (quick comparison)

- **Custodial wallet**: Provider controls keys; easier UX; relies on provider security and policies.
- **Non-custodial wallet**: You control keys/seed phrase; more responsibility; typically more censorship-resistant.

### Pros and cons

**Pros**

- Easier onboarding and recovery (password reset, account recovery)
- Often includes integrated fiat on-ramps/off-ramps
- Provider may offer additional security tooling and monitoring

**Cons**

- Counterparty risk (provider hacks, insolvency, withdrawal freezes)
- Less privacy (KYC/AML is common)
- Potential censorship or transaction limits
- “Not your keys, not your coins” tradeoff

## On Sei Network

On **Sei Network** (a high-performance Layer 1 with **EVM compatibility**), custodial wallets work the same fundamental way: the custodian controls the private keys used to sign transactions that move assets on Sei. What changes is the **user experience and operational performance** due to Sei’s design:

- **Fast settlement and UX**: Sei’s ~**400ms finality** can make deposits, withdrawals, and on-chain confirmations feel near-instant compared to slower networks, improving custodial exchange workflows.
- **High throughput via parallelization**: Sei’s **parallelized execution** enables many transactions to be processed efficiently, which can help custodians handle bursts of withdrawals, hot-wallet operations, and user activity at scale.
- **EVM compatibility**: Custodians can support Sei using familiar Ethereum-style tooling—addresses, signing, and smart contract interactions—while benefiting from Sei’s performance characteristics.

### What custodians typically do on Sei

- Maintain **hot wallets** (for frequent withdrawals) and **cold wallets** (for long-term storage)
- Monitor Sei blocks/events to detect deposits and credit user accounts
- Aggregate withdrawals to optimize operational overhead
- Integrate with EVM tooling (RPC, transaction signing libraries) to support Sei-based assets and dApps

## Example: Sending a Transaction (Custodian-Style) on Sei EVM

Below is a simplified example of how a custodian (or any backend service) might sign and broadcast a transaction on Sei’s EVM using `ethers`. In a real custodial wallet, the private key would typically be protected by an HSM/KMS and strict policy controls.

```typescript
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

const RPC_URL = 'https://evm-rpc.sei-apis.com'; // Example RPC endpoint (use your preferred provider)
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(RPC_URL);

// In production, do NOT hardcode keys. Use KMS/HSM and access controls.
const privateKey = process.env.CUSTODIAN_HOT_WALLET_KEY!;
const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(privateKey, provider);

async function sendSeiEvmTx() {
  const to = '0xRecipientAddressHere000000000000000000000000';
  const value = ethers.parseEther('0.01'); // Native token amount on Sei EVM

  const tx = await wallet.sendTransaction({
    to,
    value
  });

  console.log('Broadcasted tx hash:', tx.hash);

  const receipt = await tx.wait();
  console.log('Confirmed in block:', receipt?.blockNumber);
}

sendSeiEvmTx().catch(console.error);
```

## Security Notes (Best Practices)

Custodial wallets are security-critical because a compromise of the custodian’s keys can impact many users.

- Use **segregated hot/cold storage**, withdrawal limits, and rate controls
- Use **multi-sig** or policy-based signing for large withdrawals
- Store keys in **HSM/KMS** where possible; enforce least-privilege access
- Implement **on-chain monitoring** and anomaly detection
- Maintain clear procedures for incident response and proof-of-reserves where applicable

## Summary

A custodial wallet is a wallet where a third party holds your private keys and processes transactions on your behalf. It simplifies onboarding and recovery but introduces counterparty risk and reduces direct control. On **Sei Network**, custodial wallets operate the same way while benefiting from Sei’s **parallelization**, **~400ms finality**, and **EVM compatibility** for fast, scalable transaction processing.
