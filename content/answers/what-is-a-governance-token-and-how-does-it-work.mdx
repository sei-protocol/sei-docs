# What is a Governance Token and How Does It Work?

## Overview

A **governance token** is a cryptocurrency that gives holders the ability to participate in the decision-making process of a blockchain protocol, dApp, or DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). In practice, it’s used to **vote on proposals** that can change parameters, allocate treasury funds, upgrade smart contracts, or shape long-term strategy.

If you’re searching **what is governance token**, the key idea is: it’s a token that represents **governance power**—often proportional to how many tokens you hold or lock—rather than just a medium of exchange.

## How It Works

### Governance rights and voting power

Governance tokens typically confer:

- **Voting rights** on proposals (e.g., parameter changes, upgrades, grants)
- **Proposal creation rights** (often requiring a minimum threshold of tokens)
- **Delegation** (holders can delegate voting power to representatives)

Voting power is commonly determined by:

- **Token balance** (1 token = 1 vote), or
- **Locked/staked tokens** (time-locked tokens can have higher influence), or
- **Quadratic or reputation-based systems** (less common, but used to reduce whale dominance)

### Proposal lifecycle (typical flow)

1. **Discussion**: Idea is debated in forums/Discord/governance platforms.
2. **Proposal submission**: A proposal is formally created, sometimes requiring a deposit.
3. **Voting period**: Token holders vote _For/Against/Abstain_ (or more granular options).
4. **Quorum + threshold**: Proposal passes only if enough votes participate (quorum) and meets pass criteria (threshold).
5. **Execution**:
   - **On-chain execution**: Smart contracts automatically execute the approved changes.
   - **Off-chain execution**: The result guides humans/multisigs (less trust-minimized).

### On-chain vs. off-chain governance

- **On-chain governance**: Voting and execution happen on-chain via smart contracts; transparent and enforceable.
- **Off-chain governance**: Voting might happen on Snapshot or forums; execution is manual or controlled by a multisig.

### Common uses of governance tokens

- **Protocol upgrades** (new features, bug fixes, contract migrations)
- **Treasury management** (funding grants, liquidity incentives)
- **Economic parameters** (fees, collateral factors, staking rewards)
- **Validator / network settings** (in PoS systems, governance can adjust consensus parameters)

### Benefits and risks

**Benefits**

- Aligns protocol direction with stakeholders
- Decentralizes control over upgrades and funds
- Encourages community participation and long-term ownership

**Risks**

- **Whale capture**: Large holders can dominate outcomes
- **Low voter turnout**: A small minority may decide critical changes
- **Governance attacks**: Borrowed tokens (if not mitigated) can influence votes
- **Coordination overhead**: Complex proposals can be slow to finalize

## On Sei Network

Sei Network is a high-performance Layer 1 designed for fast, scalable applications and supports **EVM compatibility**, enabling Ethereum-style governance contracts to run in a familiar environment. Governance activity benefits from Sei’s performance characteristics, including **parallelized execution** and **~400ms finality**, which can make proposal interactions (creating proposals, casting votes, executing decisions) feel significantly more responsive than on slower chains.

### Governance token patterns you’ll see on Sei

Projects on Sei commonly implement governance using EVM-native patterns such as:

- **Token-based voting** (ERC-20 governance tokens)
- **Delegation** (delegate votes without transferring tokens)
- **Timelocks** for execution (delays between passing and executing proposals to increase safety)
- **Governor contracts** (OpenZeppelin Governor framework)

Because Sei is EVM compatible, teams can deploy widely used governance stacks with minimal changes, while users benefit from faster confirmations and improved UX during voting windows and execution steps.

### Example: EVM governance token interface (Solidity)

Below is a simplified interface-style example of a governance token with delegation. Many projects use OpenZeppelin’s `ERC20Votes` under the hood.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

interface IGovernanceToken {
    function delegate(address delegatee) external;
    function getVotes(address account) external view returns (uint256);
    function getPastVotes(address account, uint256 blockNumber) external view returns (uint256);
}
```

### Example: Creating and voting on proposals (Solidity, Governor pattern)

Many DAOs use an on-chain Governor contract (e.g., OpenZeppelin). The exact implementation varies, but the core methods look like this:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

interface IGovernor {
    function propose(
        address[] memory targets,
        uint256[] memory values,
        bytes[] memory calldatas,
        string memory description
    ) external returns (uint256 proposalId);

    function castVote(uint256 proposalId, uint8 support) external returns (uint256);
    // support: 0 = Against, 1 = For, 2 = Abstain
}
```

### Example: Interacting from TypeScript (ethers.js)

Using Sei’s EVM RPC endpoint, you can interact with governance contracts like on any EVM chain.

```typescript
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

const rpcUrl = process.env.SEI_EVM_RPC!;
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(rpcUrl);

const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY!, provider);

// Example: governance token delegation
const tokenAddress = '0xYourGovernanceToken';
const tokenAbi = ['function delegate(address delegatee) external', 'function getVotes(address account) view returns (uint256)'];

const token = new ethers.Contract(tokenAddress, tokenAbi, wallet);

async function delegateVotes(delegatee: string) {
  const tx = await token.delegate(delegatee);
  await tx.wait();
  const votes = await token.getVotes(await wallet.getAddress());
  console.log('Current votes:', votes.toString());
}

delegateVotes('0xDelegateeAddress');
```

## Key Takeaways

- A governance token is a token that grants **voting and proposal influence** over a protocol or DAO.
- Governance typically involves **proposal submission → voting → quorum/threshold checks → execution**, ideally on-chain.
- On Sei Network, governance token systems can leverage **EVM compatibility** and benefit from **parallelization** and **~400ms finality**, improving the speed and user experience of governance interactions.
