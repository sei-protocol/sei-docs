# What is a Non-custodial Wallet and How Does It Work?

## Overview

A **non-custodial wallet** is a crypto wallet where **you control the private keys (or seed phrase)** that authorize transactions and access funds. In other words, **you—not an exchange or third party—are the custodian** of your assets. When people ask **“what is non-custodial wallet”**, the core idea is self-sovereign ownership: you hold the credentials needed to sign transactions on-chain.

## How It Works

### Keys, seed phrases, and ownership

Non-custodial wallets are built around public-key cryptography:

- **Seed phrase (mnemonic):** A human-readable backup (typically 12–24 words) that can deterministically generate many private keys.
- **Private key:** A secret used to **sign transactions**. Whoever has it can move funds.
- **Public key / address:** Derived from the private key; used to **receive funds** and identify accounts on-chain.

If you lose the seed phrase/private key, there is usually **no account recovery**—that’s the tradeoff for full control.

### Signing vs. broadcasting

A non-custodial wallet typically does two things:

1. **Creates and signs a transaction locally** (often on your device).
2. **Broadcasts the signed transaction** to the blockchain network via an RPC provider or node.

Because the signature is created with your private key, the network can verify you authorized the action **without ever seeing your private key**.

### Interaction with dApps

When connecting to decentralized applications (dApps), the wallet acts like a permissions layer:

- The dApp requests an action (e.g., “sign this message” or “send this transaction”).
- The wallet prompts you to approve.
- If approved, the wallet signs and returns the signature/transaction for broadcast.

### Token approvals (important for EVM chains)

On EVM-compatible networks, interacting with ERC-20 tokens often requires **an approval** before a contract can spend your tokens:

- `approve(spender, amount)` grants allowance.
- Then the contract can call `transferFrom(...)` up to the allowed amount.

This is a common source of risk if users approve unlimited amounts to untrusted contracts.

```solidity
// Example: ERC-20 allowance pattern (conceptual)
IERC20 token = IERC20(0xToken);
token.approve(0xSpender, 1_000e18); // allow spender to move up to 1000 tokens
```

## On Sei Network

Sei is a high-performance Layer 1 with **EVM compatibility** and fast finality (often cited around **~400ms**). A non-custodial wallet on Sei works the same foundational way—**you hold the keys and sign transactions**—but the user experience benefits from Sei’s performance and parallelization.

### EVM compatibility

Because Sei supports EVM, non-custodial wallets that work across EVM ecosystems can also support Sei’s EVM environment. Practically, this means:

- You can use familiar Ethereum-style accounts (0x addresses).
- You sign EVM transactions and interact with smart contracts (DEXs, NFT markets, lending protocols) similarly to other EVM networks.

### Fast confirmations and parallel execution

With Sei’s design goals around throughput and fast finality:

- Transactions you sign in a non-custodial wallet can reach finality quickly (often around **~400ms**).
- Sei’s **parallelization** can help networks remain responsive under load, improving dApp interactions like swaps, mints, and contract calls.

### Example: Sending an EVM transaction on Sei (ethers.js)

Below is a minimal TypeScript example of a non-custodial flow: you load a private key locally, sign, and send a transaction to Sei’s EVM via an RPC endpoint.

```typescript
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

// 1) Connect to a Sei EVM RPC endpoint
const rpcUrl = 'https://YOUR_SEI_EVM_RPC';
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(rpcUrl);

// 2) Load your non-custodial wallet (private key stored locally/securely)
const privateKey = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY as string;
const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(privateKey, provider);

async function main() {
  // 3) Create + sign + broadcast a transaction
  const tx = await wallet.sendTransaction({
    to: '0xRecipientAddress...',
    value: ethers.parseEther('0.01')
  });

  console.log('Tx hash:', tx.hash);

  // 4) Wait for confirmation/finality
  const receipt = await tx.wait();
  console.log('Confirmed in block:', receipt?.blockNumber);
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

## Benefits of a Non-Custodial Wallet

- **Full control of funds:** No intermediary can freeze or restrict withdrawals.
- **Permissionless access:** Use dApps directly from your wallet.
- **Portability:** Restore the wallet on another device using the seed phrase.
- **Transparency:** Actions are verified by on-chain signatures rather than platform promises.

## Risks and Best Practices

### Key risks

- **Key/seed loss:** Funds may be unrecoverable.
- **Phishing and malicious approvals:** Signing the wrong message or approving a malicious contract can lead to loss.
- **Device compromise:** Malware can exfiltrate keys if not properly secured.

### Best practices

- Back up your **seed phrase offline** (never in cloud notes/screenshots).
- Use a **hardware wallet** for significant funds.
- Review transaction details and **limit token approvals** when possible.
- Verify dApp URLs and contract addresses before connecting.

## Non-Custodial vs. Custodial Wallet (Quick Comparison)

| Feature                    | Non-custodial wallet | Custodial wallet                |
| -------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Who controls private keys? | You                  | Third party (exchange/provider) |
| Account recovery           | Usually none         | Often available (email/KYC)     |
| Censorship resistance      | Higher               | Lower (platform rules)          |
| Ease of use                | More responsibility  | More convenience                |
| dApp access                | Direct               | Sometimes limited               |

## Summary

A non-custodial wallet is a wallet where **you control the private keys**, meaning you directly authorize and sign blockchain transactions without relying on a custodian. In general, it works by generating keys from a seed phrase, signing transactions locally, and broadcasting them to the network. On Sei Network, non-custodial wallets benefit from **EVM compatibility**, **parallelization**, and fast finality (around **~400ms**), making on-chain interactions feel notably faster while preserving self-custody.
