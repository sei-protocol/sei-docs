# What is a Mainnet and How Does It Work?

## Overview

A **mainnet** (main network) is the production blockchain network where real transactions occur using assets with real economic value. When people ask **“what is mainnet”**, they’re referring to the live, fully operational version of a blockchain that users and applications rely on for permanent, immutable records.

Mainnets contrast with **testnets** (used for testing with valueless tokens) and **devnets/localnets** (private environments for development).

## How It Works

### Mainnet vs. Testnet (and why it matters)

- **Mainnet:** Real users, real tokens, real stakes. Transactions are intended to be final and economically meaningful.
- **Testnet:** Used to test wallets, smart contracts, and infrastructure without risking real funds. Tokens are typically free via faucets and have no market value.
- **Devnet/Localnet:** Small, controlled networks (often run locally) for rapid iteration and debugging.

### Core components of a mainnet

A mainnet functions through several core building blocks:

1. **Nodes**

   - **Full nodes** download and verify the chain’s data.
   - **Validator nodes** participate in consensus (depending on the chain design) to propose/confirm blocks.

2. **Consensus**

   - A consensus protocol (often Proof of Stake) ensures participants agree on the order and validity of transactions.
   - Consensus provides **finality**, meaning transactions become extremely difficult (or impossible) to reverse after confirmation.

3. **Transactions and blocks**

   - Users sign transactions with private keys and broadcast them to the network.
   - Validators/orderers include transactions in blocks.
   - Blocks are finalized according to the chain’s consensus rules, making history tamper-resistant.

4. **Fees (gas)**

   - Users pay fees to compensate validators and prevent spam.
   - Smart contract execution usually costs more than simple transfers due to computation.

5. **Smart contracts and dApps (if supported)**
   - On smart-contract platforms, mainnet is where contracts are deployed for real usage.
   - Contract upgrades (if possible) and operational security become critical because bugs impact real funds.

### Typical workflow: from testnet to mainnet

1. Develop and test smart contracts on local environments.
2. Deploy to a testnet and run integration tests (wallets, indexers, frontends).
3. Audit and harden security assumptions.
4. Deploy to mainnet, initialize configuration, and monitor.

## On Sei Network

Sei Network’s mainnet is the live Sei blockchain where transactions and smart contracts execute with real economic value, benefiting from Sei’s performance-oriented design. Sei is **EVM-compatible**, enabling Ethereum-style smart contracts and tooling while operating as a high-performance Layer 1.

### What “mainnet” means on Sei

- **Real assets and real users:** Tokens and application states on Sei mainnet carry real value.
- **Fast user experience:** Sei targets **~400ms finality**, so transactions can reach finality quickly compared to many traditional L1s.
- **High throughput via parallelization:** Sei is designed to process many operations efficiently, leveraging **parallelization** to increase capacity and reduce bottlenecks—particularly important for high-volume apps.

### EVM compatibility on Sei mainnet

Because Sei supports EVM workflows, developers can:

- Write and deploy **Solidity** contracts.
- Use familiar tooling like `ethers`, Hardhat, Foundry, and standard wallet flows.
- Treat Sei mainnet like an EVM chain for deployment and integration, while benefiting from Sei’s performance characteristics.

### Example: Deploying to Sei mainnet (conceptual)

Below is a minimal example of how teams typically switch from testnet to mainnet by changing the RPC endpoint and chain configuration.

```typescript
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

const RPC_URL = process.env.SEI_MAINNET_RPC!; // e.g. https://<sei-mainnet-rpc>
const PRIVATE_KEY = process.env.DEPLOYER_KEY!;

async function main() {
  const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(RPC_URL);
  const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(PRIVATE_KEY, provider);

  // Example: send a simple transaction (native token transfer)
  const tx = await wallet.sendTransaction({
    to: '0xYourRecipientAddressHere',
    value: ethers.parseEther('0.01')
  });

  console.log('Submitted tx:', tx.hash);
  const receipt = await tx.wait();
  console.log('Finalized in block:', receipt?.blockNumber);
}

main().catch((e) => {
  console.error(e);
  process.exit(1);
});
```

### Example: Simple Solidity contract for mainnet deployment

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

contract Counter {
    uint256 public number;

    function increment() external {
        number += 1;
    }

    function setNumber(uint256 newNumber) external {
        number = newNumber;
    }
}
```

Deploying this contract to Sei mainnet makes its state and interactions real and permanent, so audits, access control, and monitoring are essential.

## Key Takeaways

- **What is mainnet?** The live, production blockchain network where transactions and smart contract execution have real economic value.
- Mainnets rely on nodes, consensus, fees, and finalized blocks to provide security and permanence.
- **On Sei Network**, mainnet combines **EVM compatibility** with high-performance design, including **parallelization** and **~400ms finality**, enabling fast and scalable real-world applications.
