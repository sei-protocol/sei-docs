# What Are Staking Rewards and How Do They Work?

## Overview

Staking rewards are incentives paid to users who lock (stake) their tokens to help secure and operate a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain. In practice, **what is staking rewards** refers to the yield (often paid in the network’s native token) earned for participating in consensus—either by running a validator or delegating stake to one.

These rewards typically come from newly issued tokens (inflation), transaction fees, or a combination of both, and they can vary based on network conditions, validator performance, and staking participation rates.

## How It Works

### 1) Staking secures PoS networks

In PoS, validators are chosen to propose and attest to blocks based on the amount of stake they control (their own tokens plus tokens delegated to them). By staking, participants create “skin in the game,” aligning incentives to behave honestly.

### 2) Validators and delegators

- **Validators** run infrastructure (nodes) that participate in consensus. They are responsible for uptime, correct signing, and producing/validating blocks.
- **Delegators** stake by delegating tokens to a validator without running validator hardware themselves. Delegators share in the validator’s rewards, minus a validator commission.

### 3) Where staking rewards come from

Common sources include:

- **Block rewards / inflation:** New tokens minted and distributed to stakers.
- **Transaction fees:** A portion of gas/fees paid by users is distributed to validators/delegators.

The exact formula differs per chain, but most systems distribute rewards proportional to stake and validator participation.

### 4) Distribution and compounding

Rewards may be:

- Credited automatically to staking balances,
- Claimable via a transaction (then optionally restaked),
- Or periodically distributed depending on chain design.

Many stakers **compound** by claiming rewards and staking them again to increase future rewards.

### 5) Key variables that affect rewards

- **Network staking ratio:** If a larger share of total supply is staked, per-token rewards may decrease (depending on issuance design).
- **Validator commission:** A percentage taken by the validator before delegators receive rewards.
- **Validator performance:** Downtime or missed signatures can reduce rewards.
- **Slashing risk:** Misbehavior (double-signing, prolonged downtime, or protocol-defined faults) can cause a portion of stake to be penalized.

### 6) Unstaking and lockups

Many PoS networks impose an **unbonding period** (a delay between requesting unstake and receiving funds) to protect security and discourage short-term attacks.

## On Sei Network

Sei is a high-performance Layer 1 with **fast finality (~400ms)** and an **EVM-compatible** execution environment, designed for parallelized throughput. Staking on Sei follows the typical PoS model: validators secure the chain and delegators can stake to validators to earn rewards.

### How staking rewards apply on Sei

- **Delegation model:** Users can delegate SEI to validators and receive staking rewards proportional to their delegated stake (net of validator commission).
- **Validator set performance:** Because Sei targets high throughput and quick finality, validator uptime and correct participation are especially important—poor performance can reduce effective rewards and may incur penalties per protocol rules.
- **Fast settlement context:** Sei’s low-latency finality helps applications (including EVM apps) settle quickly, while staking provides the security guarantees behind that rapid confirmation experience.
- **EVM compatibility:** Staking is a core protocol function (consensus/security), while EVM compatibility enables smart contracts and tooling. Users often interact with staking via wallets, explorers, or native staking modules rather than directly through Solidity contracts.

### Typical workflow (delegator)

1. Choose a validator (consider commission, uptime, reputation).
2. Delegate tokens (stake).
3. Rewards accrue as the validator participates in consensus.
4. Claim rewards (and optionally redelegate/compound).
5. Unstake (subject to any network unbonding rules).

## Example Commands (Conceptual)

Exact commands depend on your wallet/provider and Sei’s CLI tooling, but the flow typically looks like this with Cosmos-SDK-style transactions:

```bash
# Delegate (stake) tokens to a validator
seid tx staking delegate <validator-operator-address> 1000000usei \
  --from <your-key> --chain-id <chain-id> --gas auto --fees <fee>

# Withdraw staking rewards
seid tx distribution withdraw-rewards <validator-operator-address> \
  --from <your-key> --chain-id <chain-id> --gas auto --fees <fee>

# Unbond (unstake) tokens
seid tx staking unbond <validator-operator-address> 1000000usei \
  --from <your-key> --chain-id <chain-id> --gas auto --fees <fee>
```

## Key Takeaways

- **What is staking rewards?** It’s the token-denominated yield earned for helping secure a PoS network by staking directly as a validator or delegating to one.
- Rewards are typically funded by **inflation and/or transaction fees**, and distributed based on stake and validator participation.
- On **Sei Network**, staking rewards support a validator-secured chain designed for **parallelized performance** and **~400ms finality**, with **EVM compatibility** enabling a broad smart contract ecosystem on top of that secure base.
