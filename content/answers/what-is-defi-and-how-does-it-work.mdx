# What is DeFi and How Does It Work?

## Overview

DeFi (Decentralized Finance) is a category of financial applications built on public blockchains that lets users borrow, lend, trade, earn yield, and manage assets without relying on traditional intermediaries like banks or brokers. In DeFi, software (smart contracts) enforces rules transparently, and users keep control of their funds through their own wallets.

In other words, **what is DeFi**? It’s an open, programmable financial system where anyone with an internet connection can interact with financial services directly on-chain.

## How It Works

### Core building blocks

- **Wallets & self-custody:** Users connect a wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to DeFi apps and sign transactions. Funds are typically controlled by the user’s private keys, not by an institution.
- **Smart contracts:** On-chain programs that hold assets, apply rules (interest rates, collateral requirements, swap pricing), and execute transactions deterministically.
- **Tokens:** Assets represented on-chain (e.g., stablecoins, governance tokens, LP tokens). Tokens can represent currencies, claims on pooled liquidity, voting power, or receipts for deposits.
- **Liquidity pools & AMMs (Automated Market Makers):** Instead of matching buyers and sellers in an order book, many DEXs use pools of tokens and a pricing formula to enable swaps.
- **Oracles:** Services that deliver off-chain data (like asset prices) to smart contracts, enabling lending, derivatives, and other price-dependent logic.
- **Collateral & overcollateralization:** Many DeFi lending markets require borrowers to post collateral worth more than the loan to reduce default risk.
- **Composability (“money legos”):** DeFi protocols can integrate with each other—one protocol’s token can be used as collateral in another, enabling complex strategies.

### Typical DeFi flows

#### 1) Swapping assets (DEX)

1. User connects a wallet to a DEX.
2. User approves the DEX contract to spend a token (ERC-20 approval model).
3. User submits a swap transaction.
4. The smart contract transfers tokens, calculates output based on pool state, and returns the swapped asset to the user.

#### 2) Lending and borrowing

1. Lenders deposit assets into a lending pool and receive interest-bearing receipts.
2. Borrowers deposit collateral and borrow another asset.
3. The protocol tracks collateralization ratios; positions may be liquidated if undercollateralized.
4. Interest accrues automatically based on utilization and risk parameters.

#### 3) Yield and liquidity providing

1. Liquidity providers deposit a pair of tokens into a pool.
2. They receive LP tokens representing their share.
3. Fees (and sometimes incentives) accrue to LPs, but LPs can face **impermanent loss** if relative prices move.

### Security and risks to understand

- **Smart contract risk:** Bugs or exploits can cause loss of funds.
- **Oracle risk:** Bad price feeds can trigger incorrect liquidations or mispricing.
- **Liquidity and market risk:** Slippage, impermanent loss, and volatility can affect outcomes.
- **Governance risk:** Parameter changes (fees, collateral factors) can materially impact users.

## On Sei Network

Sei is a high-performance Layer 1 designed to support high-throughput, low-latency DeFi. DeFi on Sei works the same conceptually—wallets sign transactions, smart contracts run on-chain, and users interact with DEXs, lending protocols, and other apps—but it benefits from Sei’s performance characteristics:

- **Parallelization:** Sei is built to execute many transactions concurrently when possible, improving throughput for DeFi activity like swaps, liquidations, and arbitrage.
- **~400ms finality:** Fast finality helps DeFi apps feel more responsive and can reduce uncertainty during time-sensitive actions (e.g., trading, rebalancing, liquidation events).
- **EVM compatibility:** Solidity-based smart contracts and EVM tooling can be used to build and deploy DeFi applications on Sei, making it easier to port existing Ethereum-compatible designs or launch new ones with familiar developer workflows.

### Example: Connecting to Sei and reading chain info (TypeScript)

```typescript
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

// Use Sei's EVM-compatible RPC endpoint (replace with an official/your chosen RPC).
const rpcUrl = 'https://YOUR_SEI_EVM_RPC';
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(rpcUrl);

async function main() {
  const [blockNumber, network] = await Promise.all([provider.getBlockNumber(), provider.getNetwork()]);

  console.log('Chain ID:', network.chainId.toString());
  console.log('Latest block:', blockNumber);
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

### Example: Basic ERC-20 approval pattern (Solidity)

Many DeFi interactions require approving a protocol to spend your tokens before calling the protocol’s main function (swap, deposit, etc.).

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

interface IERC20 {
    function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
}

contract ApproveExample {
    function approveToken(
        address token,
        address spender,
        uint256 amount
    ) external {
        // In practice, approval is usually done directly by the user wallet,
        // but this illustrates the common DeFi pattern.
        IERC20(token).approve(spender, amount);
    }
}
```

## Why DeFi Matters

DeFi expands access to financial services by making them:

- **Open:** Anyone can participate without permission (subject to the app’s own rules and local laws).
- **Transparent:** On-chain transactions and many protocol parameters are publicly verifiable.
- **Programmable:** Developers can build new financial products by composing existing primitives.
- **Interoperable:** Standards like ERC-20 and EVM tooling make integrations easier across apps—especially on EVM-compatible chains like Sei.

## Key Takeaways

- **What is DeFi?** A decentralized, smart contract–based financial ecosystem on blockchains.
- DeFi operates through wallets, tokens, smart contracts, liquidity pools, lending markets, and oracles.
- On **Sei Network**, DeFi can take advantage of **parallel execution**, **~400ms finality**, and **EVM compatibility** to support fast, scalable on-chain finance.
