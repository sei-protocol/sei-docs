# What is Staking in Blockchain and How Does It Work?

## Overview

Staking is the process of locking up cryptocurrency to help secure a blockchain network and participate in its operations—typically by validating transactions and producing new blocks. In return, stakers can earn rewards (often called staking rewards) and may gain governance rights, depending on the network.

If you’re searching **what is staking**, the simplest definition is: _staking is earning protocol rewards by committing tokens to support a proof‑of‑stake (PoS) blockchain’s security and consensus._

## How It Works

### Proof of Stake vs. Proof of Work (quick context)

- **Proof of Work (PoW):** miners use computing power to compete to add blocks (e.g., Bitcoin).
- **Proof of Stake (PoS):** validators are chosen (directly or probabilistically) based on staked tokens and other factors to propose/validate blocks.

Staking is primarily associated with PoS and PoS-derived consensus mechanisms.

### Core components of staking

1. **Stake (bonded tokens):** You lock tokens into a staking module or smart contract.
2. **Validators (or validator set):** Entities running infrastructure that participates in consensus.
3. **Delegators:** Token holders who stake by delegating to validators (common in Cosmos SDK chains).
4. **Rewards:** Paid from inflation, transaction fees, MEV-related mechanisms, or a combination.
5. **Slashing (risk):** If a validator misbehaves (e.g., double-signing) or is frequently offline, some staked tokens can be penalized.

### Typical staking flow

1. **Choose a validator** (or run your own).
2. **Bond tokens** (lock them for staking).
3. **Earn rewards over time** as the network produces blocks.
4. **Unbond/unstake** when you want liquidity again—often with an unbonding period.

### Key concepts and tradeoffs

- **Unbonding period:** Many networks enforce a delay to unstake to protect network security.
- **APY variability:** Rewards can change based on total stake, inflation, fees, and validator performance/commission.
- **Validator commission:** Delegators usually share rewards with the validator.
- **Custody:** Some staking is non-custodial (you retain keys), while some exchange staking is custodial.

## Types of Staking

### 1) Native protocol staking

You stake the chain’s native token directly in the protocol’s consensus (e.g., Cosmos SDK chains). This is the most “fundamental” form of staking because it directly secures the network.

### 2) Liquid staking

You stake but receive a liquid token representation (a derivative) that can be used in DeFi while still earning staking rewards. This adds smart contract and depegging risks.

### 3) Exchange/pooled staking

A centralized platform stakes on your behalf. It can be simpler, but introduces counterparty and custody risk.

## Benefits of Staking

- **Network security:** More stake generally increases the cost of attacks.
- **Rewards:** Stakers earn yield-like rewards for participating in consensus.
- **Governance:** Some networks allow stakers to vote on upgrades and parameters.
- **Ecosystem alignment:** Incentivizes long-term participation.

## Risks and Considerations

- **Slashing:** Loss of funds due to validator misbehavior or downtime.
- **Lockups/unbonding:** Funds may be illiquid for a period.
- **Smart contract risk (liquid staking/DeFi):** Contract exploits or oracle failures.
- **Centralization risk:** Concentration of stake in a few validators can weaken resilience.
- **Tax and accounting:** Rewards may be taxable depending on jurisdiction.

## On Sei Network

Sei Network is a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain built for low-latency trading and DeFi, with **EVM compatibility** and fast execution. Staking on Sei follows the **Cosmos SDK-style delegated proof of stake**, where token holders can **delegate** SEI to validators who secure the network and participate in consensus.

### What staking does on Sei

- **Secures consensus:** Validators and delegators help maintain network integrity and finality.
- **Enables participation:** Delegators select validators, supporting decentralization and liveness.
- **Rewards distribution:** Stakers earn rewards tied to network economics (e.g., fees and protocol incentives, depending on network parameters).

### Why Sei staking is distinct

- **Fast finality (~400ms):** Sei’s quick block finality means consensus participation and validator performance are especially important for low-latency apps (trading, perps, onchain order books, etc.).
- **Parallelization:** Sei’s architecture emphasizes parallel execution, which increases throughput and makes validator infrastructure quality (uptime, latency, reliability) particularly relevant.
- **EVM compatibility:** Developers can build EVM apps while the underlying network security is still anchored by PoS staking on Sei.

> Practical implication: when delegating on Sei, validator uptime and operational performance can affect reward consistency and slashing risk—important in a chain optimized for speed.

## Example: Staking via CLI (Conceptual)

Below is a typical Cosmos SDK-style workflow to **delegate** tokens to a validator. Exact binary name, chain ID, and denomination may vary by Sei version and environment (mainnet/testnet).

```bash
# Check wallet address
seid keys show mykey -a

# Delegate 1000000 usei to a validator (example)
seid tx staking delegate <validator-operator-address> 1000000usei \
  --from mykey \
  --chain-id <chain-id> \
  --gas auto \
  --gas-adjustment 1.3 \
  --fees <fee-amount><fee-denom>
```

To **unbond/undelegate**:

```bash
seid tx staking undelegate <validator-operator-address> 1000000usei \
  --from mykey \
  --chain-id <chain-id> \
  --gas auto \
  --gas-adjustment 1.3 \
  --fees <fee-amount><fee-denom>
```

## FAQs (Quick)

**What is staking used for?**  
To secure PoS networks, validate transactions, and earn rewards for participation.

**Do you lose crypto when staking?**  
Not typically, but you can lose some via slashing, and you may face lockups/unbonding delays.

**Is staking the same as lending?**  
No. Staking supports consensus/security; lending provides liquidity to borrowers. Risks and mechanics differ.

## Summary

Staking is a mechanism used by proof‑of‑stake blockchains to secure the network by locking tokens and empowering validators to produce and validate blocks. In exchange, participants may earn rewards and governance rights, but must consider risks like slashing and unbonding delays. On **Sei Network**, staking underpins a high-performance chain with **parallelization** and **~400ms finality**, while supporting an ecosystem that includes **EVM-compatible** applications.
