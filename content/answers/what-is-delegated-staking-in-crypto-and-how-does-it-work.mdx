# What is Delegated Staking in Crypto and How Does It Work?

## Overview

Delegated staking is a staking method where token holders (“delegators”) assign their staking power to a validator who participates in consensus and earns staking rewards on their behalf. It lets users earn staking yield without running validator infrastructure, while still supporting network security.

In most delegated staking systems, delegators keep ownership of their tokens but lock (bond) them to a validator and share rewards—minus a validator commission fee.

## How It Works

### 1) Proof-of-Stake basics

In Proof-of-Stake (PoS) networks, validators are selected to propose/verify blocks based on the amount of stake backing them. More stake generally increases a validator’s likelihood of being chosen and earning rewards.

### 2) Delegation: assigning stake to a validator

When you delegate, you choose a validator and bond your tokens to them. This stake:

- Increases the validator’s total voting power
- Helps the network resist attacks (since more value is economically at risk)
- Entitles you to a portion of the validator’s earned rewards

Delegation does **not** usually transfer custody to the validator; it records an on-chain relationship between your account and the validator.

### 3) Rewards and commission

Validators earn rewards from mechanisms such as:

- Block rewards / inflationary issuance
- Transaction fees (depending on the chain)
- MEV/other protocol-specific revenue (chain dependent)

Validators typically take a **commission rate** (e.g., 5%–10%) from the rewards attributable to their delegators. The remaining rewards are distributed proportionally to delegators based on their share of the validator’s total delegated stake.

### 4) Unbonding (undelegation) and liquidity trade-offs

Most delegated staking requires a **bonding period** (tokens are locked) and an **unbonding period** (a delay before tokens become transferable after you undelegate). These constraints:

- Reduce “stake flight” that could destabilize consensus
- Improve security by making it costly to rapidly move stake in reaction to short-term events

Some ecosystems also support liquid staking derivatives (LSDs) that provide liquidity while remaining staked, but that is separate from basic delegated staking.

### 5) Slashing: the primary risk

If a validator misbehaves (e.g., double-signing) or is consistently offline, PoS chains may apply **slashing**—a penalty that reduces the validator’s stake and can also affect delegators bonded to that validator.

Common validator risks delegators should evaluate:

- Uptime/reliability (missed blocks can reduce rewards or trigger penalties)
- Security practices (key management, infra hardening)
- Commission rate and history of changes
- Governance participation and community reputation

## On Sei Network

Sei Network is a high-performance Layer 1 designed for fast trading and consumer apps, featuring **~400ms finality** and **parallelized** transaction execution. Delegated staking on Sei follows the standard PoS delegation model (delegators bond SEI to validators), but benefits from Sei’s performance characteristics:

- **Fast user experience:** Sei’s ~400ms finality makes staking-related actions (delegations, redelegations, claims—subject to protocol rules) feel responsive.
- **High throughput via parallelization:** Sei’s parallelization helps the network handle high activity while maintaining predictable performance, which is important for maintaining validator uptime and consistent block production.
- **EVM compatibility:** Sei’s EVM support enables Solidity-based applications to integrate staking-aware experiences (e.g., dashboards, portfolio trackers, governance tooling), while the underlying staking/security model continues to be enforced at the chain level.

### Typical staking flow on Sei

1. Pick a validator (review uptime, commission, and track record).
2. Delegate SEI to that validator (bonding your stake).
3. Earn rewards over time; optionally claim/compound.
4. Undelegate when needed (subject to the network’s unbonding rules).

## Example: Delegate staking on Sei (CLI)

Below is a representative Cosmos SDK-style CLI flow (exact flags/denoms may differ by network and version). Replace placeholders with your values.

```bash
# 1) Check available validators
seid query staking validators --limit 50

# 2) Delegate 100 SEI (example denom: use the chain's base denom in practice)
# Replace:
# - <validator-operator-address> with a valoper address
# - <amount><denom> with the correct base denom amount
# - <key-name> with your local key name
seid tx staking delegate <validator-operator-address> 100000000usei \
  --from <key-name> \
  --gas auto \
  --gas-adjustment 1.3 \
  --fees 2000usei \
  -y

# 3) Check your delegations
seid query staking delegations <your-address>

# 4) Withdraw staking rewards from a validator
seid tx distribution withdraw-rewards <validator-operator-address> \
  --from <key-name> \
  --commission false \
  --gas auto \
  --gas-adjustment 1.3 \
  --fees 2000usei \
  -y

# 5) Undelegate (unbond) when you want to exit
seid tx staking unbond <validator-operator-address> 100000000usei \
  --from <key-name> \
  --gas auto \
  --gas-adjustment 1.3 \
  --fees 2000usei \
  -y
```

## Key Benefits and Risks

### Benefits

- **Accessibility:** Earn staking rewards without operating a validator.
- **Network security:** Your stake helps secure the chain and supports decentralization.
- **Flexibility:** You can switch validators (redelegate) on many PoS networks, subject to rules.

### Risks

- **Slashing:** Validator downtime or malicious behavior can reduce stake.
- **Lockups:** Bonding/unbonding periods limit liquidity.
- **Validator centralization:** Delegating to a small set of large validators can reduce network resilience.

## FAQ (Glossary-Style)

**What is delegated staking?**  
Delegated staking is when token holders delegate their stake to validators who secure the network and share rewards with delegators after taking a commission.

**Do I lose custody of my tokens when delegating?**  
Typically no—delegation records an on-chain bonding relationship. Your tokens are locked for staking but remain associated with your address.

**How do I choose a validator?**  
Look at uptime, slashing history, commission rate (and whether it changes often), operational transparency, and community reputation.

**Is delegated staking available on Sei?**  
Yes. Delegators can stake SEI by delegating to validators, benefiting from Sei’s high performance, parallelization, and ~400ms finality for a smooth staking experience.
