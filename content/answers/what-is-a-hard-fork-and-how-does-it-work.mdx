# What is a Hard Fork and How Does It Work?

## Overview

A **hard fork** is a backward-incompatible change to a blockchain’s protocol rules that causes nodes running the old software to reject blocks produced under the new rules. In practice, this can **split the network into two chains** if some participants upgrade and others do not. If everyone upgrades, the chain continues as one with the new rules.

## How It Works

In a blockchain, nodes validate blocks using a shared set of consensus rules (e.g., transaction formats, gas rules, signature schemes, block limits). A hard fork changes those rules in a way that **older clients cannot validate**.

### 1) Rule change and activation

A hard fork is typically implemented as a protocol upgrade with an agreed activation mechanism, such as:

- **Block height activation:** new rules start at a specific block number.
- **Time-based activation:** new rules start after a specific timestamp.
- **Governance-triggered activation:** validators vote and the upgrade is enabled when conditions are met.

### 2) Network upgrade (coordination)

Validators, full nodes, exchanges, indexers, and wallet providers must upgrade their software to follow the new rules. If a meaningful portion does not upgrade, the network can diverge.

### 3) Chain split (optional but possible)

After activation:

- **Upgraded nodes** accept blocks that follow the new rules.
- **Non-upgraded nodes** reject those blocks and continue building on the old rules.

This results in two networks with shared history up to the fork point, but different futures. Users may end up with assets on both chains depending on how the split is handled.

### 4) Outcomes

Hard forks commonly happen for:

- **Protocol improvements:** performance, scalability, fee market changes.
- **Security fixes:** patching vulnerabilities quickly.
- **Feature additions:** new opcodes, new transaction types, new cryptography.
- **Governance disagreements:** differing visions for the protocol can lead to persistent chain splits.

### Hard Fork vs Soft Fork

- **Hard fork:** backward-incompatible; old nodes cannot follow without upgrading.
- **Soft fork:** backward-compatible tightening of rules; old nodes can still accept new blocks (though they may not understand all details).

## On Sei Network

On **Sei Network**, a hard fork corresponds to a **protocol upgrade** that changes consensus or execution rules such that nodes must update to remain compatible. Because Sei is designed for high performance—leveraging **parallelization** in execution and offering **~400ms finality**—upgrades can be especially important for improving throughput, latency, and developer experience while preserving deterministic and secure state transitions.

Key implications on Sei:

- **Validator-led upgrades:** As a Proof-of-Stake network, validators coordinate upgrades to ensure continuity of consensus and block production.
- **Fast finality considerations:** With ~400ms finality, network coordination around the activation point is important to avoid temporary divergence and to keep applications operating smoothly.
- **EVM compatibility:** When Sei introduces EVM-related enhancements (e.g., execution changes, gas accounting adjustments, precompile updates), these may be delivered via hard forks/protocol upgrades. EVM tooling (contracts, RPC clients, indexers) may need updates alongside the chain upgrade.
- **Parallelized execution:** Upgrades may include changes that affect how transactions are scheduled or executed in parallel. This can improve performance but must remain deterministic so all nodes reach the same state.

### What developers and operators should do

If Sei announces a protocol upgrade (hard fork), typical best practices include:

- Upgrade node binaries by the recommended version before the activation height.
- Monitor release notes for any EVM/RPC behavior changes that could affect dApps, indexers, and off-chain services.
- Test smart contracts and infrastructure against the upgraded network (testnet/devnet) if behavior changes are expected.

## Example: Node Upgrade Workflow (Operator)

Below is a typical workflow pattern for upgrading a node ahead of a hard fork (exact commands and versions depend on the release):

```bash
# 1) Stop the node service
sudo systemctl stop seid

# 2) Install/replace the binary with the upgraded version (example)
# (Use the official Sei release instructions for the correct artifact/version)
curl -L https://example.com/sei-release/seid -o /usr/local/bin/seid
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/seid

# 3) Confirm version
seid version

# 4) Restart the node service
sudo systemctl start seid

# 5) Verify logs for successful sync and readiness before the upgrade height
journalctl -u seid -f
```

## Why Hard Forks Matter

For anyone searching **“what is hard fork”**, the key takeaway is that a hard fork is how blockchains introduce major changes that require participants to upgrade. Done smoothly, it’s a coordinated protocol evolution; done with disagreement or poor coordination, it can split the chain and create two competing networks. On Sei, hard forks (protocol upgrades) are a mechanism to safely evolve a fast-finality, parallelized, EVM-compatible Layer 1 while maintaining network security and state consistency.
