# What is a Rug Pull and How Does It Work?

## Overview

A **rug pull** is a type of crypto scam where project creators or insiders suddenly drain funds or abandon a project, leaving investors with tokens that rapidly lose value or become impossible to sell. In short, it’s when liquidity, assets, or trust is “pulled out from under” the community—often after aggressive marketing and hype.

When people ask **“what is rug pull”**, they’re usually referring to these scams in DeFi and token launches, especially on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) where anyone can create a token and liquidity pool.

## How It Works

Rug pulls generally exploit the open, permissionless nature of blockchains: anyone can deploy a token contract, create a market, and attract buyers without centralized gatekeepers. Common patterns include:

### 1) Liquidity Removal (Classic DEX Rug Pull)

**Mechanism:** The team creates a token and seeds a DEX liquidity pool (e.g., TOKEN/USDC). Buyers swap into the token, increasing the pool value. The team then **withdraws the liquidity** (often by removing LP tokens), causing the token price to collapse and leaving holders unable to sell without extreme slippage.

**Typical indicators**

- Liquidity is not locked or is lockable only for a short period
- LP tokens are held by the deployer wallet (single point of control)
- Sudden, large liquidity withdrawals

### 2) Mint / Supply Inflation Rugs

**Mechanism:** The token contract allows the owner to **mint unlimited tokens** or adjust supply parameters. After buyers purchase, the owner mints a massive amount and sells into the pool, crashing the price.

**Indicators**

- Owner-controlled `mint()` or supply-changing functions
- No hard cap or unclear tokenomics
- Owner retains special privileges without time locks or governance

### 3) Trading Restriction (Honeypot-Style Rugs)

**Mechanism:** The contract is coded so that users can buy but **cannot sell**, or selling is subject to extreme taxes/fees that effectively prevent exiting. This is often disguised via complex transfer logic.

**Indicators**

- Transfer logic includes blacklists/whitelists controlled by owner
- Sell tax can be changed to 50–100%
- Only certain addresses can sell or interact with the pair

### 4) Treasury / Protocol Drain

**Mechanism:** In protocols (staking, vaults, lending), developers include backdoors or privileged roles that can **move user deposits** or withdraw protocol funds.

**Indicators**

- Upgradeable contracts without transparent governance
- Admin keys with broad permissions
- No multisig, no time locks, no audits

### 5) “Soft Rug” (Abandonment / Slow Exit)

**Mechanism:** Rather than a single event, the team slowly sells allocations, fails to deliver, disappears from social channels, or stops maintaining liquidity and development. The result is still the same: token value collapses.

**Indicators**

- Anonymous team with no accountability
- Unclear roadmap and no commits/releases
- Insider wallets steadily selling

## On Sei Network

Sei Network is a high-performance Layer 1 with **EVM compatibility** and fast, deterministic block performance (often cited around **~400ms finality**). Rug pulls can still occur on Sei—because they are primarily **smart contract and governance risks**, not “slow chain” problems.

Where Sei’s design matters:

- **EVM compatibility:** Many token and DeFi contracts on Sei follow familiar Ethereum patterns (ERC-20–style tokens, DEX pools, LP tokens). This means the _same rug pull vectors_ (liquidity removal, honeypots, admin backdoors) can exist if contracts are unsafe.
- **Fast finality (~400ms):** If a rug pull transaction is submitted (e.g., liquidity removal or admin drain), it can finalize quickly. That’s good for user experience, but it also means victims may have **little time to react** once malicious actions start.
- **Parallelization:** Sei’s parallel execution helps throughput and reduces congestion, but it doesn’t automatically protect against malicious contract logic. Security still depends on contract design, audits, and permission controls.

In practice, the best defense on Sei is the same as elsewhere: evaluate contract permissions, liquidity controls, and admin key management—especially for newly launched tokens and high-APR farms.

## Common Rug Pull Techniques (Smart Contract Patterns)

Below are simplified examples of patterns that are often abused. These snippets are for educational detection purposes.

### Owner-controlled minting

```solidity
// Simplified example: unlimited minting controlled by owner
function mint(address to, uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
    _mint(to, amount);
}
```

### Owner can change fees to block selling

```solidity
// Example: owner can set sell fee to near 100%
uint256 public sellFeeBps = 300; // 3%

function setSellFee(uint256 newFeeBps) external onlyOwner {
    require(newFeeBps <= 10000, "bps max");
    sellFeeBps = newFeeBps;
}
```

### Blacklist / restricted transfers

```solidity
mapping(address => bool) public blacklisted;

function setBlacklisted(address user, bool value) external onlyOwner {
    blacklisted[user] = value;
}

function _beforeTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal view {
    require(!blacklisted[from] && !blacklisted[to], "blacklisted");
}
```

## How to Reduce Rug Pull Risk (Quick Checklist)

### Token & contract checks

- Verify the contract is **verified** and readable on a block explorer.
- Look for **owner privileges**: minting, pausing, blacklisting, fee changes, upgrades.
- Prefer contracts with:
  - **Renounced ownership** (when appropriate), or
  - Ownership behind a **multisig** and **time lock**

### Liquidity checks (DEX tokens)

- Confirm liquidity is **locked** for a meaningful duration or controlled by a reputable mechanism.
- Identify who holds the **LP tokens**.
- Watch for unusually high **sell taxes** or dynamic fee controls.

### Project due diligence

- Avoid projects that rely solely on marketing, countdown launches, or unrealistic APR.
- Review audits (if any), but also verify whether the deployed contract matches the audited version.
- Track team wallets and token distribution to spot concentrated insider holdings.

## Summary

A rug pull is a scam where project insiders use control over liquidity, token supply, or privileged contract functions to extract value and leave holders with near-worthless tokens. It typically plays out via liquidity removal, mint-and-dump, honeypot sell restrictions, or admin-key drains. On Sei Network—despite fast finality, parallelization, and EVM compatibility—rug pull risk is primarily determined by smart contract permissions and liquidity controls, so careful onchain verification and risk checks remain essential.
