# What is a Gas War and How Does It Work?

## Overview

A **gas war** is a situation where multiple blockchain users compete to get their transactions included first by **bidding up the gas price** (the fee offered to validators/miners). In practice, this causes transaction fees to spike rapidly, and many participants overpay or fail while trying to “outbid” each other.

In other words, if you’re searching **what is gas war**, it’s the fee-based competition for limited blockspace—often triggered by highly sought-after events like NFT mints, liquidations, arbitrage, or token launches.

## How It Works

### 1) Transactions compete for limited blockspace

Most blockchains have a limited amount of computation and data they can include per block. When demand exceeds capacity, validators prioritize transactions that pay higher fees.

### 2) Users “bid” via gas price / fee parameters

Depending on the network’s fee model, users set:

- **Gas limit**: maximum units of gas the transaction can consume
- **Gas price** or **fee cap / priority tip**: how much they’re willing to pay per unit of gas

Validators generally choose transactions that maximize fee revenue (or meet other local policies), which creates an incentive to increase the offered fee during congestion.

### 3) Feedback loop: the “war”

As users observe delayed or failed transactions, they submit replacements with higher fees (or use wallet “speed up” features). Bots do this automatically. The result is a rapid escalation in fees.

### 4) Common triggers

Gas wars often occur around:

- **NFT mints** with limited supply
- **DEX arbitrage** opportunities
- **Liquidations** on lending protocols
- **Airdrop claims** or “first come, first served” launches
- **MEV (Maximal Extractable Value)** opportunities (sandwiching, backrunning, etc.)

### 5) Typical outcomes

- **Fee spikes**: Users pay far more than normal.
- **Failed or reverted transactions**: If a contract reverts (e.g., mint sold out), the user still pays for gas spent on execution up to the revert point.
- **Network congestion**: Large mempools and slower inclusion for regular users.
- **MEV dominance**: Sophisticated bots often win due to better infrastructure and strategies.

## On Sei Network

Sei Network is a high-performance Layer 1 with **EVM compatibility**, designed to reduce the user pain that commonly accompanies congestion events.

### Parallelization reduces contention

On traditional single-threaded execution paths, many transactions must be processed sequentially, increasing contention during high-demand events. **Sei’s parallelization** enables higher throughput by executing non-conflicting transactions concurrently, which helps absorb spikes in activity and can reduce the intensity of fee bidding.

### Fast finality changes the “race” dynamics

Sei targets **~400ms finality**, meaning transactions confirm quickly once included. Faster confirmation reduces the uncertainty window where users repeatedly resubmit higher-fee transactions “just in case,” which can help dampen the escalation pattern that fuels a gas war.

### EVM compatibility and familiar fee mechanics

Because Sei supports EVM execution, developers and users can interact with Sei using familiar Ethereum tooling and patterns (wallets, RPC methods, Solidity contracts). While any chain can experience fee competition during extreme demand, Sei’s performance characteristics are intended to make high-traffic events smoother for end users.

## Example: How “Bidding Up” Fees Happens (EVM-style)

Below is a simplified example using `ethers` where a user increases fee parameters to get included sooner (a common behavior during a gas war). Exact fields depend on the chain’s transaction type and fee model, but the pattern is the same: **raise the fee cap and/or tip**.

```typescript
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(process.env.RPC_URL);
const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY!, provider);

async function sendWithHigherFees(to: string, data: string) {
  // Base estimate
  const feeData = await provider.getFeeData();

  // "Bid up" by increasing maxFeePerGas and maxPriorityFeePerGas
  const maxFeePerGas = ((feeData.maxFeePerGas ?? 0n) * 12n) / 10n; // +20%
  const maxPriorityFeePerGas = ((feeData.maxPriorityFeePerGas ?? 0n) * 15n) / 10n; // +50%

  const tx = await wallet.sendTransaction({
    to,
    data,
    // Gas limit should be estimated; simplified here:
    gasLimit: 300000n,
    maxFeePerGas,
    maxPriorityFeePerGas
  });

  console.log('tx hash:', tx.hash);
  await tx.wait();
  console.log('confirmed');
}
```

## Why Gas Wars Matter (User and Developer Impact)

- **Users**: risk overpaying fees, getting stuck pending, or paying gas on reverted transactions.
- **Developers**: launches can become inaccessible to normal users; bots dominate; user experience suffers.
- **Protocols**: higher MEV extraction and volatility around critical events.

## Common Mitigations

While not always avoidable, gas wars can be reduced with design choices such as:

- **Allowlists / presales** to spread demand over time
- **Commit-reveal schemes** to reduce last-second bidding
- **Auctions** (price discovery) instead of first-come-first-served mints
- **Rate limits / per-wallet caps** to reduce bot-driven spam
- **MEV-aware designs** (e.g., batch auctions, fair ordering policies)

## Summary

A gas war is a competitive fee-bidding event where users raise gas prices to get priority inclusion during congestion. It emerges from limited blockspace, high-demand moments, and automated strategies like MEV. On Sei Network, **parallel execution**, **~400ms finality**, and **EVM compatibility** help make high-traffic periods more efficient and reduce the conditions that commonly intensify gas wars.
