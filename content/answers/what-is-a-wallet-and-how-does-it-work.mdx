# What is a Wallet and How Does It Work?

## Overview

A **wallet** is a tool (app, device, or software) that lets you **store and manage cryptographic keys** used to control assets on a blockchain. In simple terms, **what is wallet** in crypto? It’s not where coins are “kept”—it’s where the **private keys** (and signing capability) live that prove ownership and authorize transactions.

Wallets typically provide a user interface to view balances, receive funds, and sign transactions, while the blockchain itself stores the authoritative record of balances and ownership.

## How It Works

### Public/Private Keys and Addresses

Most blockchain wallets are built around asymmetric cryptography:

- **Private key**: A secret number that grants control over funds. Anyone with the private key can sign transactions and move assets.
- **Public key**: Derived from the private key; used to verify signatures.
- **Address**: A shorter, user-friendly identifier derived from the public key (or from the public key hash). You share this to receive funds.

When you “send” tokens, your wallet:

1. Constructs a transaction (recipient, amount, fees, nonce, etc.).
2. **Signs** it with your private key.
3. Broadcasts it to the network.
4. Validators include it in a block; the network updates state to reflect the transfer.

### Seed Phrases (Recovery Phrases)

Most modern wallets generate keys from a **seed phrase** (often 12 or 24 words, e.g., BIP-39). This phrase can recreate the same private keys across compatible wallets (via HD derivation such as BIP-32/44).  
**Protect the seed phrase**: it is effectively a master key.

### Custodial vs. Non-Custodial

- **Non-custodial wallets**: You control the private keys (e.g., MetaMask, hardware wallets). You’re responsible for backup and security.
- **Custodial wallets**: A third party (exchange/app) controls keys on your behalf. Easier UX, but you trust the custodian.

### Hot vs. Cold Wallets

- **Hot wallets**: Connected to the internet (browser/mobile). Convenient, higher exposure risk.
- **Cold wallets**: Offline storage (hardware wallet, air-gapped). Stronger protection, slightly less convenient.

### Signing and Verification (Conceptual Example)

Signing proves authorization without revealing the private key. Conceptually:

```typescript
// Pseudocode illustrating signing and verification flow
const txHash = hashTransaction(tx);
const signature = sign(txHash, privateKey);

// Network/validators verify:
const isValid = verifySignature(txHash, signature, publicKey);
```

### EVM Wallet Basics (EOA)

On EVM chains, most users operate via an **Externally Owned Account (EOA)** controlled by a private key. EOAs sign transactions that can:

- transfer native tokens
- call smart contracts (e.g., ERC-20 transfers)
- deploy contracts

## On Sei Network

Sei is a high-performance Layer 1 with **EVM compatibility**, which means standard EVM wallets and tooling can be used to manage accounts and interact with Sei-based dApps.

### What a Wallet Does on Sei

On Sei, a wallet typically enables you to:

- Manage your Sei address/account and balances
- Sign and send transactions to Sei validators
- Interact with EVM smart contracts (tokens, DeFi, NFTs, games)
- Connect to dApps via common wallet connectors (e.g., injected providers)

Because Sei is designed for performance, users benefit from a smooth transaction experience driven by:

- **Fast finality (~400ms)**: transactions confirm quickly, improving UX for trading and real-time apps.
- **Parallelization**: Sei’s architecture enables higher throughput, helping wallets and dApps process many independent transactions efficiently.
- **EVM compatibility**: existing Ethereum-based wallet patterns (EOA signing, RPC calls, contract interactions) apply with minimal changes.

### Connecting an EVM Wallet to Sei (Typical Steps)

1. Add Sei’s EVM network details in your wallet (RPC URL, chain ID, currency symbol).
2. Switch to the Sei network.
3. Use the wallet to sign transactions and interact with Sei dApps.

Example (generic CLI check using an EVM RPC endpoint):

```bash
# Query latest block number on Sei EVM via JSON-RPC
curl -s -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}' \
  https://YOUR_SEI_EVM_RPC_URL
```

### Sending Tokens via a Smart Contract (Solidity Context)

When you transfer an ERC-20 token on Sei’s EVM, your wallet signs a transaction calling the token contract:

```solidity
// Standard ERC-20 transfer call pattern
IERC20(token).transfer(recipient, amount);
```

Your wallet signs and submits that contract call transaction to Sei; Sei finalizes it quickly, and the token balances update on-chain.

## Key Security Tips

- Never share your **seed phrase** or **private key**.
- Prefer a **hardware wallet** for significant value.
- Verify dApp URLs and transaction prompts before signing.
- Keep backups offline and consider multi-device redundancy for recovery.

## Summary

A wallet is a key-management and transaction-signing tool that lets you control blockchain assets. In general, it works by generating/storing private keys, deriving addresses, and signing transactions that the network verifies. On Sei Network, wallets work with familiar EVM patterns while benefiting from Sei’s **parallelization** and **~400ms finality** for fast, responsive on-chain interactions.
