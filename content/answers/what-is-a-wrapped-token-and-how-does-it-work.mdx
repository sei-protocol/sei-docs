# What is a Wrapped Token and How Does It Work?

## Overview

A **wrapped token** is a blockchain token that represents another asset (often from a different chain) at a **1:1 value**, backed by reserves and redeemable for the underlying asset. In other words, _what is wrapped token_ usually refers to a “proxy” version of an asset that’s been packaged to work in an ecosystem where the original asset isn’t natively supported.

Wrapped tokens are commonly used to bring liquidity and functionality (like DeFi trading, lending, and collateralization) to assets across different blockchains without moving the original chain’s native token standard into the new environment.

## How It Works

Wrapped tokens typically rely on a **mint-and-burn** model with **custody or locking**:

1. **Deposit / Lock the underlying asset**

   - A user (or bridge) deposits the original asset into a smart contract (lock) or with a custodian (hold).
   - Example: locking BTC to create WBTC; locking ETH to create WETH (ETH isn’t an ERC-20 token, so wrapping standardizes it).

2. **Mint wrapped tokens**

   - Once the deposit is verified, an equivalent amount of wrapped tokens is **minted** on the target chain/standard.
   - The wrapped token supply should match the amount of underlying asset locked/held.

3. **Use the wrapped token**

   - The wrapped token can now be transferred, traded, or used in smart contracts as a standard token for that environment (e.g., ERC-20 on EVM chains).

4. **Redeem (burn) to get the original asset back**
   - The user returns wrapped tokens to the system, which **burns** them.
   - The locked/held underlying asset is **released** to the user.

### Key Properties and Tradeoffs

- **Pegged value (1:1)**: Wrapped tokens aim to track the underlying asset’s value because they are redeemable for it.
- **Bridge/custody risk**: Many wrapped tokens depend on bridges, validators, or custodians—this introduces trust and smart contract risks.
- **Liquidity and composability**: Wrapping enables assets to participate in DeFi protocols, AMMs, lending markets, and other contract interactions.

## On Sei Network

On **Sei Network**, wrapped tokens enable assets from other ecosystems to be used in Sei’s high-performance environment, including **EVM-compatible** smart contracts and tooling. This matters because:

- **EVM compatibility** means wrapped assets can be used directly in Solidity-based protocols deployed on Sei (DEXs, lending, derivatives, vaults).
- **Parallelization** allows the network to process many transactions concurrently, improving throughput and responsiveness for trading-heavy activity where wrapped asset liquidity is often used.
- **~400ms finality** can provide a faster user experience for transfers and DeFi interactions involving wrapped tokens (e.g., swaps, collateral updates, liquidations), reducing waiting time between actions.

Wrapped tokens on Sei are commonly minted and redeemed via **bridges** or cross-chain protocols that lock/burn an asset on the source chain and mint/unlock its wrapped representation on Sei. As with any network, the exact safety model depends on the specific bridge (smart contracts, validator set, security assumptions, audits, and operational controls).

## Example: Using a Wrapped Token in an EVM Contract (Sei)

Many wrapped tokens on EVM chains follow the ERC-20 interface. Below is a basic Solidity example that accepts deposits of a wrapped token (e.g., a wrapped BTC or wrapped ETH representation) on Sei’s EVM.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

interface IERC20 {
    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    function balanceOf(address who) external view returns (uint256);
}

contract WrappedTokenVault {
    IERC20 public immutable wrappedToken;

    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    constructor(address _wrappedToken) {
        wrappedToken = IERC20(_wrappedToken);
    }

    function deposit(uint256 amount) external {
        require(amount > 0, "amount=0");
        require(wrappedToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount), "transferFrom failed");
        balances[msg.sender] += amount;
    }

    function withdraw(uint256 amount) external {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "insufficient balance");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        require(wrappedToken.transfer(msg.sender, amount), "transfer failed");
    }

    function vaultBalance() external view returns (uint256) {
        return wrappedToken.balanceOf(address(this));
    }
}
```

## Example: Checking a Wrapped Token Balance (TypeScript)

If you’re interacting with Sei’s EVM, you can use standard Ethereum libraries to query ERC-20 balances.

```typescript
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

const RPC_URL = process.env.SEI_EVM_RPC!;
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(RPC_URL);

const erc20Abi = ['function balanceOf(address) view returns (uint256)', 'function decimals() view returns (uint8)'];

async function main() {
  const tokenAddress = '0xYourWrappedTokenAddress';
  const user = '0xYourWalletAddress';

  const token = new ethers.Contract(tokenAddress, erc20Abi, provider);
  const [bal, decimals] = await Promise.all([token.balanceOf(user), token.decimals()]);

  console.log('Balance:', ethers.formatUnits(bal, decimals));
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

## Best Practices and Security Considerations

- **Verify backing and redemption**: For “what is wrapped token” questions, the most important detail is whether the token is actually redeemable 1:1 and how reserves are proven (on-chain locking vs. custodian attestations).
- **Assess bridge risk**: Review audits, security model, validator assumptions, and incident history of the bridge issuing the wrapped token.
- **Use canonical assets where possible**: Prefer widely adopted, well-audited wrapped assets and official/recognized bridge routes for Sei.
- **Confirm token contracts**: Always use the correct contract address (especially on EVM networks) to avoid spoofed tokens.

## Summary

A wrapped token is a 1:1 representation of another asset, created so it can be used in a different blockchain environment or token standard. It works by locking (or custodying) the underlying asset and minting a wrapped version, then burning the wrapped token to redeem the original. On Sei Network, wrapped tokens are especially useful because Sei’s EVM compatibility, parallelized execution, and ~400ms finality make cross-asset DeFi interactions faster and more composable—while the primary risk remains the security model of the bridge or custodian backing the wrap.
