# What is a Block Explorer and How Does It Work?

## Overview

A **block explorer** is a web-based tool that lets anyone search, view, and verify blockchain data such as blocks, transactions, wallet addresses, and smart contract activity. In simple terms, it’s a “search engine” for a blockchain that provides transparency by turning raw on-chain data into readable pages.

If you’re asking **what is block explorer**, the key idea is this: it helps users independently confirm what happened on-chain—without trusting a third party.

## How It Works

Block explorers typically work by connecting to one or more blockchain nodes and indexing the data those nodes produce. The explorer then serves that indexed data through a user interface (and often an API) so people can quickly search and filter information.

### 1) Data Source: Blockchain Nodes

A block explorer reads data from the blockchain via:

- **RPC (Remote Procedure Call)** endpoints (e.g., JSON-RPC for EVM chains)
- Node APIs (e.g., Tendermint/CometBFT RPC on Cosmos-based chains)
- Event subscriptions (for real-time updates)

Nodes provide canonical chain data such as:

- Block headers and block contents
- Transactions and receipts/logs
- State changes (balances, contract storage updates)
- Validator and consensus information (chain-dependent)

### 2) Indexing and Storage

Because searching directly through full node data can be slow, explorers usually:

- Continuously ingest new blocks
- Parse transactions, internal calls, logs/events, and metadata
- Store the parsed results in a database optimized for queries (e.g., Postgres, Elasticsearch)

This indexing layer enables common explorer features like:

- Full-text search by **tx hash**, **block height**, or **address**
- Filtering token transfers by **contract** and **event signature**
- Tracking historical balances and activity

### 3) Decoding Transactions and Smart Contract Events

On smart contract chains, explorers decode:

- **Transaction input data** to identify which contract function was called
- **Event logs** (e.g., ERC-20 `Transfer`) to show token movements
- **Contract ABIs** (when verified) to present human-readable function names and parameters

When a contract is “verified,” the explorer can match on-chain bytecode to source code and ABI, making contract interactions easier to understand.

### 4) Confirmations and Finality

Explorers show whether a transaction is:

- **Pending** (broadcast but not yet included in a block)
- **Included** (in a block)
- **Finalized** (high confidence it won’t be reverted, depending on the chain’s finality model)

Some chains use probabilistic finality (confidence increases with more blocks), while others provide fast deterministic finality through consensus.

### 5) Common Explorer Pages and Fields

A typical explorer surfaces:

- **Transaction page:** hash, status, block/height, gas/fees, sender/receiver, logs, token transfers
- **Block page:** height, timestamp, proposer, tx count, gas used, block hash
- **Address page:** balance, tx history, token holdings, contract interactions
- **Contract page:** bytecode, ABI, verified source, read/write methods

## On Sei Network

Sei is a high-performance Layer 1 with **EVM compatibility**, designed for throughput and speed, including **~400ms finality**. A block explorer on Sei serves the same core purpose—transparent verification of on-chain activity—but it becomes especially useful for observing Sei’s fast block production and parallel execution behavior at scale.

### What You’ll See on a Sei Block Explorer

On Sei, an explorer typically exposes:

- **Rapid block confirmations** reflecting Sei’s ~400ms finality
- **EVM transaction details** (hash, from/to, gas, calldata, logs) similar to Ethereum explorers
- **Smart contract events** for ERC-20/721-style contracts deployed via Sei’s EVM
- Network and consensus-related metadata (chain-dependent), including block timing and throughput indicators

### Parallelization and Explorer Indexing

Sei’s performance characteristics (including parallelization) mean explorers and indexers often need to:

- Keep up with higher transaction throughput
- Efficiently process large volumes of EVM logs/events
- Provide near real-time updates for dApps and traders

From a user perspective, this translates into faster visibility of transaction inclusion and finality, and more responsive search and filtering when tracking activity.

## Practical Usage Examples

### Find a Transaction (by Hash)

Use an RPC call to retrieve transaction details (EVM-compatible JSON-RPC):

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://YOUR_SEI_EVM_RPC_ENDPOINT \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id":1,
    "method":"eth_getTransactionByHash",
    "params":["0xYOUR_TX_HASH"]
  }'
```

To fetch the receipt (status, logs, gas used):

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://YOUR_SEI_EVM_RPC_ENDPOINT \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id":1,
    "method":"eth_getTransactionReceipt",
    "params":["0xYOUR_TX_HASH"]
  }'
```

### Look Up an Address Balance

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://YOUR_SEI_EVM_RPC_ENDPOINT \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id":1,
    "method":"eth_getBalance",
    "params":["0xYOUR_ADDRESS","latest"]
  }'
```

### Decode Token Transfers (ERC-20 `Transfer` Event)

Explorers detect common events like `Transfer(address,address,uint256)` via log topics. The event signature hash is:

```solidity
// keccak256("Transfer(address,address,uint256)")
bytes32 constant TRANSFER_TOPIC =
  0xddf252ad1be2c89b69c2b068fc378daa952ba7f163c4a11628f55a4df523b3ef;
```

Indexers/explorers query logs and decode them to show token transfers on transaction and address pages.

## Why Block Explorers Matter

A block explorer is essential for:

- **Verifying payments and transfers** (who sent what, and when)
- **Debugging smart contract interactions** (function calls, logs, reverts)
- **Auditing and transparency** (independent on-chain verification)
- **Operational monitoring** (tracking confirmations/finality, fees, throughput)

On Sei, these benefits are amplified by fast finality and EVM compatibility—users can confirm outcomes quickly, while developers can inspect contract behavior using familiar Ethereum-style transaction and event data.
