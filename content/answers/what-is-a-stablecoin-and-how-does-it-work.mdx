# What is a Stablecoin and How Does It Work?

## Overview

A **stablecoin** is a cryptocurrency designed to keep its price **stable** relative to a reference asset, most commonly a fiat currency like the **US dollar (USD)**. If you’re searching **“what is stablecoin”**, the simplest answer is: it’s a digital token that aims to combine crypto’s speed and programmability with the predictable value of traditional money.

Stablecoins are widely used for payments, trading, remittances, on-chain savings, and as a “base currency” in DeFi because they reduce exposure to the volatility typical of many crypto assets.

## How It Works

Stablecoins maintain price stability through one (or a combination) of these mechanisms:

### 1) Fiat-Collateralized Stablecoins (Off-Chain Reserves)

These stablecoins are backed by **cash and cash-equivalents** (e.g., bank deposits, short-term government bills) held by a custodian. In many models, users can **mint** new stablecoins by depositing fiat and **redeem** stablecoins for fiat, which helps keep the token near its peg (e.g., $1).

**How the peg holds (conceptually):**

- If the stablecoin trades above $1, arbitrageurs mint at $1 and sell higher, pushing price down.
- If it trades below $1, arbitrageurs buy below $1 and redeem for $1, pushing price up.

**Trade-offs:**

- Pros: typically strong price stability.
- Cons: relies on custodians, banking rails, audits/attestations, and regulatory compliance.

### 2) Crypto-Collateralized Stablecoins (On-Chain Reserves)

These stablecoins are backed by **cryptocurrency collateral** locked in smart contracts, usually **overcollateralized** (e.g., $150 of collateral to mint $100 stablecoin) to handle crypto price swings. If collateral value falls too far, positions can be **liquidated** to protect solvency.

**Core components:**

- Collateral vaults / positions
- Overcollateralization ratio
- Oracles to track market prices
- Liquidation mechanisms and incentives

**Trade-offs:**

- Pros: transparent, on-chain, less reliance on traditional banks.
- Cons: can be complex; collateral volatility and oracle risk.

### 3) Algorithmic Stablecoins (Supply/Demand Mechanisms)

Algorithmic stablecoins attempt to maintain a peg by **adjusting token supply**, incentives, or using secondary tokens—often without full collateral backing.

**Trade-offs:**

- Pros: capital efficient in theory.
- Cons: historically higher risk; peg can fail under stress if incentives break.

### 4) Commodity-Backed Stablecoins

These are backed by real-world commodities (e.g., gold), aiming to track the commodity price rather than fiat.

**Trade-offs:**

- Pros: exposure to commodity value on-chain.
- Cons: depends on custody and redemption guarantees.

### Key Concepts You’ll See With Stablecoins

- **Peg:** the target price (e.g., 1 stablecoin = $1).
- **Mint/Burn:** creating tokens (mint) and destroying them (burn) to manage supply and redemptions.
- **Reserves/Collateral:** assets backing the stablecoin’s value.
- **Oracles:** data feeds used by smart contracts to get market prices.
- **Depegging:** when a stablecoin deviates meaningfully from its target price.

## On Sei Network

Stablecoins on **Sei Network** are typically issued and used as **ERC-20 tokens** on Sei’s EVM, making them easy to integrate with existing Ethereum tooling (wallets, indexers, Solidity contracts). Sei’s design—optimized for high throughput with **parallelization** and fast block execution—supports stablecoin use cases like high-frequency trading, on-chain payments, and DeFi collateral management at scale, with **~400ms finality** improving user experience for transfers and swaps.

Common stablecoin activities on Sei include:

- **Payments & transfers:** fast settlement and quick confirmation UX due to near-instant finality.
- **DEX trading:** stablecoins serve as quote assets (e.g., stablecoin pairs) and help reduce volatility exposure.
- **Lending/borrowing:** stablecoins are frequently used as borrowed assets or collateral, depending on protocol design.
- **Treasury and accounting:** stable-value units simplify on-chain bookkeeping for DAOs and apps.

### Example: Interacting With a Stablecoin (ERC-20) in Solidity on Sei

Below is a minimal example showing how a dApp might accept stablecoin payments using the ERC-20 interface:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

interface IERC20 {
    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    function balanceOf(address owner) external view returns (uint256);
}

contract StablecoinCheckout {
    IERC20 public immutable stablecoin;
    address public immutable merchant;

    constructor(address stablecoinAddress, address merchantAddress) {
        stablecoin = IERC20(stablecoinAddress);
        merchant = merchantAddress;
    }

    function pay(uint256 amount) external {
        // User must approve() this contract for `amount` first
        require(stablecoin.transferFrom(msg.sender, merchant, amount), "transfer failed");
    }
}
```

### Example: Sending a Stablecoin Transfer (EVM) With Ethers.js

This example shows a basic ERC-20 transfer flow (network RPC and chain ID omitted for brevity—use Sei’s EVM endpoints):

```typescript
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

const ERC20_ABI = ['function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) returns (bool)', 'function decimals() view returns (uint8)'];

async function sendStablecoin(rpcUrl: string, privateKey: string, stablecoinAddress: string, to: string, amountHuman: string) {
  const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(rpcUrl);
  const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(privateKey, provider);

  const token = new ethers.Contract(stablecoinAddress, ERC20_ABI, wallet);
  const decimals: number = await token.decimals();

  const amount = ethers.parseUnits(amountHuman, decimals);
  const tx = await token.transfer(to, amount);
  await tx.wait();
  return tx.hash;
}
```

## Why Stablecoins Matter

Stablecoins are a foundational building block for crypto because they enable:

- **Low-volatility on-chain value transfer**
- **More predictable pricing** for goods and services
- **Liquidity** for trading and DeFi
- **Programmable money** for apps (subscriptions, payroll, escrow)

On Sei, these benefits are amplified by fast settlement (**~400ms finality**) and scalable execution via **parallelization**, making stablecoin-powered applications feel closer to traditional fintech speed while remaining on-chain and composable.

## Risks and Considerations

Even though stablecoins aim to be stable, they are not risk-free:

- **Reserve/custody risk (fiat-backed):** solvency, banking access, transparency of reserves.
- **Smart contract and oracle risk (crypto-backed):** bugs, oracle manipulation, liquidation failures.
- **Liquidity/market risk:** thin liquidity can cause temporary depegs.
- **Regulatory risk:** changes in compliance requirements can affect issuance/redemption.

## Summary

If you’re asking **what is stablecoin**, it’s a cryptocurrency that targets a stable price—usually pegged to fiat like USD—using reserves, collateral, and/or algorithmic mechanisms. Stablecoins power much of on-chain commerce and DeFi, and on **Sei Network** they benefit from EVM compatibility and fast, scalable execution—enabling near-instant transfers and efficient trading with **~400ms finality**.
