# EVM (general)

## Overview

The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the runtime environment for smart
contracts, enabling compatibility with Ethereum-based dApps. Sei is an EVM
compatible blockchain. Sei's parallelized EVM ensures high performance and
efficiency.

Here are some key points about the EVM:

1. **Turing Completeness**: The EVM is Turing complete, meaning it can execute
   any computable function. This allows developers to write complex smart
   contracts.
2. **Gas**: Transactions and contract executions on the EVM compatible network
   consume gas. Gas is a measure of computational work, and users pay for it in
   usei on Sei networks . Gas ensures that malicious or inefficient code doesn’t
   overload the network.
3. **Bytecode Execution**: Smart contracts are compiled into bytecode (low-level
   machine-readable instructions) and deployed to the EVM compatible network.
   The EVM executes this bytecode.

## Smart contract languages

The two most popular languages for developing smart contracts on the EVM are
**Solidity** and **Vyper**.

### Solidity

- Object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts.
- Curly-bracket language that has been most profoundly influenced by C++.
- Statically typed (the type of a variable is known at compile time).
- Supports:
  - Inheritance (you can extend other contracts).
  - Libraries (you can create reusable code that you can call from different
    contracts – like static functions in a static class in other object oriented
    programming languages).
  - Complex user-defined types.

#### Example solidity contract

```solidity copy
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
pragma solidity >= 0.7.0;

contract Coin {
    // The keyword "public" makes variables
    // accessible from other contracts
    address public minter;
    mapping (address => uint) public balances;

    // Events allow clients to react to specific
    // contract changes you declare
    event Sent(address from, address to, uint amount);

    // Constructor code is only run when the contract
    // is created
    constructor() {
        minter = msg.sender;
    }

    // Sends an amount of newly created coins to an address
    // Can only be called by the contract creator
    function mint(address receiver, uint amount) public {
        require(msg.sender == minter);
        require(amount < 1e60);
        balances[receiver] += amount;
    }

    // Sends an amount of existing coins
    // from any caller to an address
    function send(address receiver, uint amount) public {
        require(amount <= balances[msg.sender], "Insufficient balance.");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        balances[receiver] += amount;
        emit Sent(msg.sender, receiver, amount);
    }
}
```

### Vyper

- Pythonic programming language
- Strong typing
- Small and understandable compiler code
- Efficient bytecode generation
- Deliberately has less features than Solidity with the aim of making contracts
  more secure and easier to audit. Vyper does not support:
  - Modifiers
  - Inheritance
  - Inline assembly
  - Function overloading
  - Operator overloading
  - Recursive calling
  - Infinite-length loops
  - Binary fixed points

#### Example Vyper contract

```python copy
# Open Auction

# Auction params
# Beneficiary receives money from the highest bidder
beneficiary: public(address)
auctionStart: public(uint256)
auctionEnd: public(uint256)

# Current state of auction
highestBidder: public(address)
highestBid: public(uint256)

# Set to true at the end, disallows any change
ended: public(bool)

# Keep track of refunded bids so we can follow the withdraw pattern
pendingReturns: public(HashMap[address, uint256])

# Create a simple auction with `_bidding_time`
# seconds bidding time on behalf of the
# beneficiary address `_beneficiary`.
@external
def __init__(_beneficiary: address, _bidding_time: uint256):
    self.beneficiary = _beneficiary
    self.auctionStart = block.timestamp
    self.auctionEnd = self.auctionStart + _bidding_time

# Bid on the auction with the value sent
# together with this transaction.
# The value will only be refunded if the
# auction is not won.
@external
@payable
def bid():
    # Check if bidding period is over.
    assert block.timestamp < self.auctionEnd
    # Check if bid is high enough
    assert msg.value > self.highestBid
    # Track the refund for the previous high bidder
    self.pendingReturns[self.highestBidder] += self.highestBid
    # Track new high bid
    self.highestBidder = msg.sender
    self.highestBid = msg.value

# Withdraw a previously refunded bid. The withdraw pattern is
# used here to avoid a security issue. If refunds were directly
# sent as part of bid(), a malicious bidding contract could block
# those refunds and thus block new higher bids from coming in.
@external
def withdraw():
    pending_amount: uint256 = self.pendingReturns[msg.sender]
    self.pendingReturns[msg.sender] = 0
    send(msg.sender, pending_amount)

# End the auction and send the highest bid
# to the beneficiary.
@external
def endAuction():
    # It is a good guideline to structure functions that interact
    # with other contracts (i.e. they call functions or send ether)
    # into three phases:
    # 1. checking conditions
    # 2. performing actions (potentially changing conditions)
    # 3. interacting with other contracts
    # If these phases are mixed up, the other contract could call
    # back into the current contract and modify the state or cause
    # effects (ether payout) to be performed multiple times.
    # If functions called internally include interaction with external
    # contracts, they also have to be considered interaction with
    # external contracts.

    # 1. Conditions
    # Check if auction endtime has been reached
    assert block.timestamp >= self.auctionEnd
    # Check if this function has already been called
    assert not self.ended

    # 2. Effects
    self.ended = True

    # 3. Interaction
    send(self.beneficiary, self.highestBid)
```
