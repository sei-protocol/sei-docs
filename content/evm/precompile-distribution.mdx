# Distribution Precompile

**Address:** `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001007`

## Example

```typescript copy
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

const DISTRIBUTION = '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001007';
const ABI = ['function setWithdrawAddress(address withdrawAddr) returns (bool)', 'function withdrawMultipleDelegationRewards(string[] validators) returns (bool)', 'function rewards(address delegator) view returns (tuple(tuple(uint256 amount, uint256 decimals, string denom)[] coins, string validator_address)[] rewards, tuple(uint256 amount, uint256 decimals, string denom)[] total)'];

const provider = new ethers.BrowserProvider(window.ethereum);
await provider.send('eth_requestAccounts', []);
const signer = await provider.getSigner();
const distribution = new ethers.Contract(DISTRIBUTION, ABI, signer);

// Redirect rewards to a treasury contract
await distribution.setWithdrawAddress('0xYourTreasuryAddress');

// Withdraw rewards across two validators
await distribution.withdrawMultipleDelegationRewards(['seivaloper1...', 'seivaloper1...']);

// Inspect totals (amounts are raw; divide by decimals for display)
const rewards = await distribution.rewards(await signer.getAddress());
console.log(rewards.total);
```

## Notes

- Withdraw calls revert during `staticcall`; they must be regular transactions
- Commission withdrawals succeed only when `msg.sender` matches the validator operator address
- Returned amounts are raw integersâ€”divide by `decimals` before converting to display units
- v6.1.11+ emits synthetic distribution logs tagged with `synthetic=true`

## Troubleshooting

<TroubleshootingTable
  rows={[
    ['cannot call distr precompile from staticcall', 'Withdraw methods called via eth_call', 'Use regular transactions for setWithdrawAddress and withdraw* calls.'],
    ['cannot delegatecall distr', 'Invoked via delegatecall', 'Call distribution precompile directly from your contract.'],
    ['invalid addr', 'Withdraw address is zero or unassociated', 'Ensure the target address is associated via Addr precompile first.']
  ]}
/>
