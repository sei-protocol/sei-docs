# DappRadar Guide

DappRadar is a decentralized application (dApp) discovery platform and analytics provider.

## What this guide covers:

This covers the four main areas:

- Listing Process - How to get your dApp on DappRadar
- Analytics & Tracking - Understanding metrics and data collection
- ERC-4337 Integration - Account abstraction implementation
- Advanced Features - Premium options and visibility boosting

## How to List Your dApp on DappRadar

### Prerequisites and Requirements

Before submitting your dApp, ensure you have:

**Essential Requirements:**

- A deployed dApp with smart contracts on supported blockchain networks
- Project name and clear description
- Official website URL
- Logo (250x250 pixels, PNG or JPG, max 150KB)
- Smart contract addresses for all relevant contracts
- Valid email address for account creation

**Recommended Assets:**

- High-quality screenshots of your dApp interface
- Demo video (YouTube URL recommended)
- Social media links (Twitter, Discord, Telegram, etc.)
- Detailed project description
- Clear category classification

### Step-by-Step Listing Process

#### Step 1: Create Your DappRadar Account

1. Visit [dappradar.com](https://dappradar.com) and click "Sign Up"
2. Provide your email address and create a secure password
3. Verify your email address through the confirmation link
4. Complete your profile setup
5. Optionally connect your crypto wallet for enhanced features

#### Step 2: Prepare Your Submission Materials

At a minimum, you must include the following information to submit your project/dApp to DappRadar:

**Required Information:**

- **Project Name**: Clear, distinctive name for your dApp
- **Website URL**: Your official project website
- **Logo**: High-quality 250x250 pixel image
- **Short Description**: Concise overview (50-100 words)
- **Full Description**: Detailed explanation of your dApp's functionality
- **Category**: Select the most appropriate category (Gaming, DeFi, NFT, etc.)
- **Blockchain Protocol(s)**: Networks where your dApp is deployed
- **Smart Contract Addresses**: All relevant contract addresses

**Optional but Recommended:**

- Screenshots showcasing your dApp's interface
- Demo video explaining key features
- Social media profiles and communication channels
- Token information (if applicable)
- Community links

#### Step 3: Submit Your DApp

1. Navigate to the DappRadar submission page
2. Complete all required fields in the submission form
3. Specify the protocols your dApp is deployed on. You can select multiple protocols here
4. After selecting at least one protocol, you'll be prompted to enter your dApp's contract address(es) for each protocol. Please try to fill all the contract address(es) on your dApp for better accuracy of the data
5. Upload your logo and any additional visual assets
6. Provide social media links and additional resources
7. Review terms and conditions
8. Submit your application

#### Step 4: Review Process

Submissions are reviewed by the DappRadar team and will be published if the dapp is considered suitable for listing

**Review Criteria:**

- Technical functionality and smart contract verification
- Compliance with platform terms of service
- Quality and completeness of submission materials
- Project legitimacy and authenticity

### Dapp Feature Page

Your approved dApp receives a dedicated page featuring:

- Analytics dashboard
- Project description and media
- Social links and community resources
- Real-time performance metrics
- User reviews and community engagement
- Boost power from community support

If your application uses ERC-4337 account abstraction, you will need to complete additional configuration steps to ensure DappRadar properly tracks your user activity and transaction data. See the [Account Abstraction Integration](#account-abstraction-integration-erc-4337-dapps-only) section below for more details.

## Account Abstraction Integration (ERC-4337 dApps Only)

This section is specifically for developers using ERC-4337 account abstraction in their dApps. If your application uses traditional Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) for user wallets, you can skip this entire section and proceed directly to the [Analytics](#analytics) section below.

If your dApp leverages ERC-4337 smart contract wallets to provide enhanced user experiences like gasless transactions, social recovery, or custom authentication methods, you'll need to complete additional configuration steps to ensure DappRadar properly tracks your user activity and transaction data.

### Prerequisites for ERC-4337 Integration

Before beginning the integration process, ensure you have:

- Deployed or identified the EntryPoint contract on your target blockchain
- Implemented Smart Contract Wallet following ERC-4337 specification
- Access to your smart contract wallet factory addresses
- Understanding of your bundler and paymaster configurations (if applicable)

### Integration Process with DappRadar

**Step 1: Configuration Setup**
Access the GitHub repository at https://github.com/dappradar/erc4337-configurations

**Step 2: Submit Configuration**
Your ERC-4337 configuration must include the following components:

1. **EntryPoint Configuration**

   - Contract address and ABI
   - Supported chain identifiers
   - Network-specific parameters

2. **Smart Contract Wallet Specifications**

   - Wallet factory addresses
   - Implementation contract details
   - Validation function signatures

3. **Bundler Integration**
   - Supported bundler endpoints
   - Fee calculation methods
   - Transaction ordering preferences

**Step 3: Testing and Validation**

- Verify UserOperation handling
- Test transaction bundling and execution
- Validate gas abstraction functionality
- Ensure proper data attribution in DappRadar

**Example Configuration:**
You can find an example of existing ERC-4337 configuration for Sei: https://github.com/dappradar/erc4337-configurations/blob/main/chain-config/sei/erc4337.json

## Analytics

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

**1. Unique Active Wallets (UAW)**

- Metric for user engagement
- Counts distinct wallet addresses interacting with smart contracts
- Available in daily, weekly, and monthly aggregations
- Trend analysis and growth tracking

**2. Transaction Metrics**

- Total transaction count per period
- Transaction volume in native tokens and USD
- Average transaction value
- Transaction frequency patterns

**3. Smart Contract Interactions**

- Function call distribution
- Contract usage patterns
- Gas consumption analysis
- Error rate monitoring

**4. Financial Metrics**

- Total Value Locked (TVL) for DeFi protocols
- Revenue generation (if applicable)
- Token price correlation
- Market capitalization impact

### Data Accuracy Considerations

**Factors Affecting Data Accuracy:**

1. **On-Chain vs Off-Chain Activity**
   In the trading card game Splinterlands, you make a blockchain transaction when you claim rewards, battle an opponent, open a card pack, stake your tokens, and so on. In this game, almost every action gets tracked by the blockchain. In contrast, Axie Infinity has gameplay that takes place on centralized servers. The only on-chain actions for Axie Infinity include claiming rewards, breeding Axies and trading NFTs.

2. **Contract Coverage**
   Ensure all relevant smart contracts are included in tracking for complete data accuracy

<Callout type="info">

**Best Practices for Data Accuracy:**

- Provide comprehensive list of all contract addresses
- Include proxy contracts and implementation addresses
- Update contract lists when deploying new versions
- Monitor data discrepancies and report issues
