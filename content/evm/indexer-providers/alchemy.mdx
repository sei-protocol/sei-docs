# Alchemy Subgraphs

<Callout type="info">Standardized guide: Overview → Quickstart → Windows & Limits → Backfill → Reorgs → Examples → Troubleshooting.</Callout>

## Overview

Alchemy Subgraphs delivers managed GraphQL indexing with seamless compatibility with The Graph tooling. A dedicated Sei pipeline ([v6.1.11+](https://github.com/sei-protocol/sei-chain/releases/tag/v6.1.11)) adds:

- Native Sei EVM support with < 2 block lag under steady load.
- Automatic retries for synthetic transaction logs.
- Managed backfills with configurable block windows (default 2,000).
- Integrated monitoring dashboards (error rates, sync status, latency percentiles).

<Callout type="tip">Existing Graph CLI projects can be pointed at Alchemy by switching the gateway endpoint and redeploying without code changes.</Callout>

## Quickstart

1. [Create an Alchemy account](https://www.alchemy.com/signup) and request access to the Sei Subgraphs beta.
2. Install the CLI: `npm install -g @graphprotocol/graph-cli` (compatible with Alchemy's gateway).
3. Initialise your subgraph: `graph init --from-example sei/my-dapp`.
4. Update the network configuration:

```yaml copy
# subgraph.yaml excerpt
dataSources:
  - kind: ethereum/contract
    network: sei-mainnet
    source:
      address: '0x...'
      startBlock: 12000000
    mapping:
      apiVersion: 0.0.9
      language: wasm/assemblyscript
```

5. Authenticate: `graph auth --node https://subgraphs.sei.alchemy.com/api <API_KEY>`.
6. Deploy: `graph deploy --node https://subgraphs.sei.alchemy.com/api sei/my-dapp`.

## Windows & Limits

- Default backfill window: **2,000 blocks** (adaptive). Use CLI flag `--block-window` to customise.
- Daily compute quota: 5 hours build time on the free tier; contact support for dedicated workers.
- Concurrent backfills per project: 2.
- Reorg depth assumption: 0 (Sei finality). Payloads auto-commit once ingested; manual rewinds available via dashboard.
- Synthetic event handling: automatically tagged via `synthetic=true` metadata.

## Backfill Strategy

- Stage subgraph versions: keep `production` indexing current data while `backfill` version replays history.
- Enable automatic snapshotting every 250k blocks to accelerate restarts.
- Use the CLI `graph build` locally with `--ipfs /tmp/ipfs` to catch ABI/schema errors before deploying.
- Pair backfills with the [Indexing Best Practices](../indexing/best-practices) guidance for retry behaviour.

## Reorg Handling

Sei blocks do not revert, but Alchemy maintains a virtual reorg buffer for consistency:

- Recent blocks (last 20) stay in a mutable buffer for 5 minutes; this allows manual rewinds if upstream data is corrected.
- The dashboard shows `Finalized` vs `Buffered` heights; monitor and alert if the buffer grows unexpectedly (indicates provider lag).
- If a rewind is triggered (rare), redeploy the subgraph to the prior snapshot via the console.

## Build Pipeline Snapshot

1. **Generate schema & mappings** - Run `graph codegen` locally and ensure synthetic fields are declared in `schema.graphql` before publishing.
2. **Build & validate** - Use `graph build` with a local IPFS daemon (or bundled mock) to catch ABI mismatches fast.
3. **Deploy to Alchemy** - `graph deploy --node https://subgraphs.sei.alchemy.com/api` and monitor the dashboard until lag shrinks under 2 blocks.

## Implementation References

- [Schema checklist](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/developing/creating-a-subgraph/) - ensure every synthetic field is represented in `schema.graphql` before running codegen.
- [Sei indexing best practices](/evm/indexing-best-practices) - align window sizes and backoff strategy with Sei RPC guidance.
- [Alchemy subgraph dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/) - monitor buffered vs finalized heights, error counts, and throughput.
