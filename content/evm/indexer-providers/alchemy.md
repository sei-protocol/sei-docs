# Overview

Alchemy Subgraphs is a blockchain indexing platform with drop-in support for hosted subgraphs.
Subgraphs are an open-source tool for building custom GraphQL APIs from on-chain smart contract data.
Identify on-chain events you want to index, write AssemblyScript handlers to transform them into your preferred format, and let the subgraph automatically ingest new events for you immediately as they happen.

## Why subgraphs?

Developing an in-house indexing system is time-consuming, expensive, and requires ongoing expertise in data pipelines, devOps, and more.
Subgraphs handle the intricacies of data ingestion, decoding, and database management for you. Just define the data format you want and query live data through a GraphQL API.

## Why Alchemy Subgraphs?

- **High-performance.** We’ve benchmarked 5x faster data indexing and 2x better block lag than competitors - that’s why we’re trusted by Eigenlayer, GMX, and more.
- **No decentralized headaches.** We make payment easy (just a credit card, no staking tokens) and have guaranteed uptime compared to decentralized options.
- **Developer tooling.** Access best in class developer tools like error logs, subgraph versioning, indexing performance metrics, and more.
- **Easy migration.** If you have existing subgraphs, it takes just 5 minutes to switch over using the same command line tools you’re familiar with.
