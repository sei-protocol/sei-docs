# Example Usage

The Sei precompiles can be used like any standard smart contract on the EVM. For
example, using [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/), you can query and
execute actions on a CosmWasm contract as follows:

## Setup

To install `ethers`, run the following command in your project directory
terminal:

    ```bash copy
    npm install ethers
    npm install @sei-js/evm
    ```

Next, you'll need to use one of the precompiles in `EVM Precompiles` section. In
this example, we're going to be using the [CosmWasm precompile](/evm/precompiles/cosmwasm):

    ```typescript copy
    // Import Wasm precompile address and ABI
    // View the entire ABI here: https://github.com/sei-protocol/sei-chain/tree/evm/precompiles/wasmd
    import { WASM_PRECOMPILE_ABI, WASM_PRECOMPILE_ADDRESS } from '@sei-js/evm';
    ```

## Using the contract

Next, we'll set up a provider and contract to interact with the blockchain:

```typescript copy
import { ethers, toUtf8Bytes, toUtf8String } from 'ethers';

// Using MetaMask as the signer and provider
const provider = new ethers.BrowserProvider(window.ethereum);
const signer = await provider.getSigner();

// Create a contract with the signer
const contract = new ethers.Contract(WASM_PRECOMPILE_ADDRESS, WASM_PRECOMPILE_ABI, signer);
```

<Callout type="info">If using MetaMask, the wallet must be switched to the Sei EVM Devnet chain. Information to import the Sei EVM Devnet chain can be found [here](/learn/wallet).</Callout>

#### Querying & Executing a CosmWasm Contract

Once you have the contract, you can query and execute messages to any CosmWasm
smart contract.

```typescript copy
// Counter CosmWasm contract (used for testing on arctic-1)
// Replace with your contract as needed
const COUNTER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS = 'sei1eyfccmjm6732k7wp4p6gdjwhxjwsvje44j0hfx8nkgrm8fs7vqfsy2jxff';

// Query to get the count on the counter contract
const queryMsg = { get_count: {} };
const queryResponse = await contract.query(COUNTER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS, toUtf8Bytes(JSON.stringify(queryMsg)));
console.log(toUtf8String(queryResponse));

// Execute message to increment the count on the contract.
// No funds are attached since the increment method does not require sei.
const executeMsg = { increment: {} };
const executeResponse = await contract.execute(
  COUNTER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
  toUtf8Bytes(JSON.stringify(executeMsg)),
  toUtf8Bytes(JSON.stringify([])) // Used for sending funds if needed
);

// Wait for the transaction to be confirmed
await executeResponse.wait();
console.log(executeResponse);
```

### Executing a payable function

In this example, we execute the 'donate' method on our contract. This is similar
to the `increment` method, but also receives funds from the user and stores it
in the contract.

```typescript copy
// Execute a message to donate to the contract.
const executeMsg = { donate: {} };

// Funds are attached via overrides. This example is specific to ethers.js
const overrides = {
  value: ethers.parseEther('3.2') // Sending 3.2 sei
};
const executeResponse = await contract.execute(
  COUNTER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
  toUtf8Bytes(JSON.stringify(executeJSON)),
  toUtf8Bytes(JSON.stringify({ denom: 'usdc', amount: '100' })), // Also send 100 usdc
  overrides
);

await executeResponse.wait();
const receipt = await provider.getTransactionReceipt(executionResponse.hash);
```

For payable contracts, Sei amounts have to be sent directly to the contract
while other denoms should use the `coins` field.
