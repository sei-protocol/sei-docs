# @sei-js SDK

@sei-js is the complete TypeScript SDK for building applications on Sei Network. Whether you're creating DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, or blockchain games, @sei-js provides everything you need to ship faster.

**Works with your favorite tools:** Sei is fully EVM-compatible, so you can use Viem, Ethers.js, Foundry, Hardhat, and all your existing Ethereum development tools without any changes. @sei-js extends these tools with Sei-specific features like precompiled contracts and optimized wallet connections.

<Callout type="info">@sei-js is open source. Contribute at [github.com/sei-protocol/sei-js](https://github.com/sei-protocol/sei-js).</Callout>

## Why @sei-js?

- **Complete TypeScript support** — Full type safety for every function, contract interaction, and API response. Catch errors at compile time.
- **Production ready** — Battle-tested components used by major applications in the Sei ecosystem.
- **Optimized for Sei** — Take advantage of Sei's fast finality, low gas fees, and native features.

## Package Ecosystem

### [@sei-js/precompiles](/evm/precompiles)

Access Sei's precompiled contracts directly from your EVM applications. Interact with native blockchain functions for staking, governance, IBC, and more.

```bash
npm install @sei-js/precompiles
```

### [@sei-js/create-sei](/evm/sei-js/create-sei)

Bootstrap new Sei projects with pre-configured templates and tooling. Scaffold production-ready dApps in seconds.

```bash
npx @sei-js/create-sei app
```

### [@sei-js/sei-global-wallet](/evm/sei-global-wallet)

Connect to any Sei-compatible wallet using the EIP-6963 standard. Provides a cross-application embedded wallet experience with social login.

```bash
npm install @sei-js/sei-global-wallet
```

### [@sei-js/ledger](/evm/ledger-ethers)

Secure transaction signing with Ledger hardware wallets. Provides TypeScript helper functions for the SEI Ledger app.

```bash
npm install @sei-js/ledger
```

### [@sei-js/mcp-server](/evm/ai-tooling/mcp-server)

Teach Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, or any LLM to interact with the Sei blockchain through the Model Context Protocol.

```bash
npx @sei-js/mcp-server
```

## Quick Start

Generate a new Sei application using the CLI tool:

```bash
npx @sei-js/create-sei app
cd app
npm install
npm run dev
```

This creates a production-ready project with TypeScript, wallet connections, and Sei network integration out of the box. See the [Scaffold Sei](/evm/sei-js/create-sei) page for details on available templates and options.
