# Gas Reference

Use this page as the condensed cheat-sheet for gas-related settings and formulas on Sei. Every entry references the release where the behaviour was introduced so you can map it to your node fleet.

## Quick Lookup

<KeyValueTable
  rows={[
    ['\`max_log_no_block\`', '\`10000\` logs when no range is supplied. Increase only if you batch replay historical events.'],
    ['\`max_blocks_for_log\`', '\`2000\` block span per request. Larger values multiply DB pressure; shard queries instead.'],
    ['\`max_subscriptions_new_head\`', '\`5000\` concurrent \`eth_subscribe:newHeads\` feeds. Lower for constrained hardware.'],
    ['\`max_concurrent_trace_calls\`', '\`10\` concurrent tracer calls. Raise cautiously and pair with \`rpc_trace_pending\` alerts.'],
    ['\`trace_timeout\`', '\`30s\` per trace. Tighten if custom tracers risk monopolising threads.']
  ]}
/>

## Gas Formulas

<KeyValueTable
  rows={[
    ['Transaction receipt', '\`gasUsed = totalGasConsumed - refund\`. Refund is capped at 20% of \`gasLimit\` in line with go-ethereum rules.'],
    ['Block total', '\`block.gasUsed = sum(receipt.gasUsed)\`. Accurate for blocks produced after \`v6.1.11\`. Earlier heights may diverge.'],
    ['Estimation buffer', '\`suggestedGas = estimate * 1.05\`. Apply a 5% safety margin for user-facing UIs.']
  ]}
/>

## Release Notes

- [v6.1.11](https://github.com/sei-protocol/sei-chain/releases/tag/v6.1.11)
  - Block `gasUsed` aligned with Tendermint execution (`sei-chain@1efdec1eb`).
  - Pointer and Solo precompile flows warmed in `eth_estimateGas`.
  - Synthetic logs tagged with `synthetic: true`.
- [v1.15.7-sei-7](https://github.com/sei-protocol/go-ethereum/releases/tag/v1.15.7-sei-7)
  - Tracer length guard prevents malformed frames from panicking.
- [v1.15.7-sei-6](https://github.com/sei-protocol/go-ethereum/releases/tag/v1.15.7-sei-6)
  - RPC now returns error payload with trace data when custom tracers panic.

## Operational Tips

- Keep `max_blocks_for_log` conservative on shared endpoints; let power users run their own archive node if they need large spans.
- After upgrades, clear any CDN or proxy caches so clients immediately pick up corrected `gasUsed` values.
- Use Grafana or Prometheus exporters to monitor `rpc_gas_used` and `rpc_trace_pending` metrics if you run the RPC server from `sei-chain`.

<Callout type="warning">Always restart both the Tendermint process and the embedded RPC server once you upgrade to a release that changes gas accounting. Partial restarts can keep stale caches alive.</Callout>
