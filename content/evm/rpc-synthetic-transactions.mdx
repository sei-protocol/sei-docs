# Synthetic Transactions on Sei

Sei supports **synthetic** transactions—Cosmos-originated operations that are wrapped and surfaced through the EVM RPC layer. These include association flows, governance events, and distribution payouts. This guide explains how they appear through JSON-RPC and how to index them correctly after `v6.1.11`.

## Key Properties

<KeyValueTable
  rows={[
    ['Definition', 'Transactions originating from Cosmos modules but emitted through the EVM logs interface for compatibility.'],
    ['Flag', '`synthetic: true` in the log metadata (added in `v6.1.11`).'],
    ['Gas accounting', 'Synthetic envelopes do not contribute to EVM `gasUsed`; receipts represent only the underlying EVM execution.'],
    ['Association', 'The `sei_associate` RPC wraps a signature-based link between Sei and EVM addresses.'],
    ['Indexing', 'Use the `sei_` namespace to fetch synthetic logs alongside EVM logs.']
  ]}
/>

## Association Flow (`sei_associate`)

```json copy
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "sei_associate",
  "params": [
    {
      "custom_message": "Link my account",
      "r": "0x...",
      "s": "0x...",
      "v": "0x1c"
    }
  ]
}
```

- Sends a synthetic transaction without gas fees; verification happens in the Cosmos ante handler.
- Resulting logs appear under `sei_seiAssociation` with `synthetic: true`.
- Indexers should persist the association tuple `(seiAddress, evmAddress)` and treat the event as finalized once included in a block.

## Indexing Strategy

1. Use `sei_getLogs` to fetch both EVM and synthetic logs.
2. Filter by `{ synthetic: true }` to isolate Cosmos-originated events.
3. Store synthetic logs in a parallel table if you need to keep them separate from EVM logs.
4. Cross-reference with the Cosmos module (e.g., Distribution) for additional metadata when necessary.

## Interaction With Gas Accounting

- Synthetic envelopes do not alter receipt `gasUsed` (see `rpc-gas-accounting`).
- When computing block-level gas metrics, exclude synthetic logs entirely; they are informational signals only.
- Estimating gas for synthetic flows is unnecessary—`sei_associate` and similar methods are processed outside the EVM gas model.

## Troubleshooting

<TroubleshootingTable
  rows={[
    ['Missing synthetic flag', 'Node running pre-`v6.1.11` binary.', 'Upgrade to `v6.1.11` or later; the flag is added at log emission time.'],
    ['Association not visible via eth_getLogs', 'Querying `eth_` namespace only.', 'Switch to `sei_getLogs` or include the `sei_` namespace to fetch synthetic events.'],
    ['Duplicate association events', 'Client resubmitted association payload.', 'Treat the first inclusion as canonical; later duplicates can be ignored.']
  ]}
