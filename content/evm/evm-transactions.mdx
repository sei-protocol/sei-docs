# EVM with seid

On Sei, EVM transactions can be executed using `seid`. This is useful for developers who want to interact with EVM functionality in their applications. This guide will help you understand how to query and send transactions using the Sei CLI (`seid`) and Foundry's `cast` command, as well as how to generate transaction templates for EVM transactions.

# `seid` for EVM

You can query or send transactions to Sei easily via `seid` once you have the
`seid` command installed (see [Installing Seid](./installing-seid))

## Queries

If the machine you run these commands from are not running a node of the
network, you'll need to append `--node http://url-to-sei-cosmos-rpc` to your
command. Refer to the
[RPC Providers](/learn/rpc-providers) page for a list of
RPC endpoints.

- `seid q evm sei-addr [some EVM address]`: Gets the associated Sei address of
  the queried EVM address, if it exists on-chain.
- `seid q evm evm-addr [some Sei address]`: Gets the associated EVM address of
  the queried Sei address, if it exists on-chain.
- `seid q evm erc20 [erc20 address] [method] [arguments...]`: Query the ERC20
  contract at given address using the given method/arguments.
- `seid q evm payload [abi-filepath] [method] [arguments...]`: Generate the
  hexadecimal payload of the requested method call given an ABI.
- `seid q evm pointer [type] [pointee]`: Gets the pointer contract of the
  requested pointee. The `type` parameter can be one of "NATIVE", "CW20",
  "CW721", "ERC20", or "ERC721", and `pointee` is the target contract address.
  For "NATIVE" type, `pointee` would be the native denom name instead.

## Transactions

Sending transactions via CLI requires you to have keys added via
`seid keys add`. You can then specify the key you want to use by appending
`--from=[key name]` to your command.

If the machine you run these commands from are not a node of the network, you'd
need to append `--evm-rpc http://url-to-sei-evm-rpc` to your command. Refer to
the [RPC Providers](/learn/rpc-providers) page for a list
of RPC endpoints.

- `seid tx evm associate-address`: Associates the Sei address and EVM address
  on-chain for the sending key.
- `seid tx evm send [to EVM address] [amount in wei]`: Sends native tokens to
  the target EVM address.
- `seid tx evm deploy [path_to_binary]`: Deploys the EVM contract specified in
  `path_to_binary`.
- `seid tx evm call-contract [addr] [payload hex]`: Sends a transaction that
  calls contract at the target address with the provided payload.
- `seid tx evm erc20-send [addr] [recipient] [amount]`: Sends ERC20 tokens of
  contract at `addr` to the target recipient.
- `seid tx evm delegate [val-addr] [amount]`: Delegates specified amount to the
  target validator address. The validator address must be in Sei/Cosmos
  validator address (`seivaloper1...`) format.

## Transaction Template Generation

The `--generate-only` flag transforms any Sei CLI transaction command into a
template generator, creating complete transaction structures without
broadcasting them. Through the `--generate-only` flag and Foundry's `cast` tool,
developers can craft, analyze, and debug transactions across in the EVM environment.

### Basic Command Pattern

The general pattern follows this structure:

```bash copy
seid tx <module> <action> <parameters> --from <key> --generate-only
```

## Generating EVM Transaction Templates

To generate an EVM transaction template, use the `evm` module with
`--generate-only`. Here's an example registering an EVM pointer:

```bash copy
seid tx evm register-evm-pointer NATIVE \
  factory/sei1ep3f207kt7julz9tjwxp2x8kluj0y9l6u0fume/gptw \
  --gas-fee-cap=100000000000 \
  --gas-limit=2500000 \
  --evm-rpc=https://localhost:8545 \
  --from tf \
  --generate-only
```

This command returns a transaction hash that you can analyze further using
Foundry's `cast` tool.

## Analyzing EVM Transactions with Cast

Once you have a transaction hash, you can use Foundry's `cast` command to
inspect the transaction details:

```bash copy
cast tx 0x5010e6600e67f04a9bc3d3b670a7c2de380b180713d9a014a5dbd76b7e2190f1 \
  --rpc-url=https://localhost:8545
```

This provides detailed transaction information:

```text copy
blockHash            0x4696d63a9a9ae88b03bcc94ccbd87f407e994b309d1dff9c0626de51ac57b76e

### Template Generation for Different Transaction Types

Generate templates for various transaction types:

```bash copy
# EVM contract interaction
seid tx evm send-tx \
  --evm-rpc=http://localhost:8545 \
  --gas-limit=2500000 \
  --from=mykey \
  --generate-only > evm_template.json
```

## Best Practices

### Transaction Analysis

When analyzing transactions:

- Always verify both native and EVM aspects of transactions
- Use `cast` to decode input data when working with EVM transactions
- Keep track of gas parameters across both layers
- Monitor transaction status on both native and EVM layers

### Error Handling

Handle potential issues across both layers:

```javascript copy
try {
  // Check native transaction status
  const nativeStatus = await checkNativeStatus(txHash);

  // If native succeeded but EVM failed, investigate EVM layer
  if (nativeStatus.success) {
    const evmStatus = await checkEvmStatus(txHash);
    if (!evmStatus.success) {
      const evmError = await cast.call(['tx', txHash, '--rpc-url', evmRpcUrl]);
      console.error('EVM transaction failed:', evmError);
    }
  }
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Transaction analysis failed:', error);
}
```

> [!WARNING]
>
> Security Best Practices
>
> - Keep private keys secure and never include them in templates
> - Use an `.env` file or other environment variable where possible when working
>   with hard coded wallet keys or mnemonics
