# NFT Contract Tutorial

## Introduction

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are unique digital assets, each possessing distinct
identities and attributes. Unlike fungible tokens created by the Token Factory,
NFTs cannot be exchanged on a like-for-like basis.

<Nfts />

This tutorial guides you through the creation and deployment of an NFT contract
on Sei. By the end, you'll have deployed your own NFT contract. Select one of
the tabs below to get started!

## EVM

In this section, we'll use Foundry to deploy an ERC-721 contract to the Ethereum
network. ERC-721 is a standard for NFT contracts on Ethereum. Learn more about
ERC-721 [here](https://erc721.org/).

### Requirements

Before we start, ensure you have:

- Installed Foundry. Follow the
  [installation guide](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation).
- A basic understanding of Solidity and smart contract development.
- A wallet with SEI tokens on devnet

> You can obtain testnet tokens [from the faucet](/learn/faucet)

### Setting Up Your Project

1. Initialize a new Foundry project:

```bash copy
forge init my-nft-project
cd my-nft-project
```

2. Install OpenZeppelin, a library for secure smart contract development.

```bash copy
forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts
```

3. Create a new Solidity file under `src/` for your NFT contract, e.g.,
   `MyNFT.sol`.

### Writing the ERC-721 Contract

1. In `src/MyNFT.sol`, start by importing OpenZeppelin's ERC-721 implementation:

```solidity copy
// contracts/MyNFT.sol
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

import {ERC721} from "openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";

contract MyNFT is ERC721 {
		constructor() ERC721("MyNFT", "MNFT") {
		}
}
```

<Callout type="info" >
	You may see an error in your IDE about importing `openzeppelin-contracts`. To
	resolve this, run this command to create `remapping.txt` in the root of your
	project:

    ```bash copy
    forge remappings > remappings.txt
    ```

</Callout>

2. Add any additional functions or overrides necessary for your NFT.

### Testing Your Contract

1. Write tests for your contract in the `test/` directory.
2. Run your tests with:

```bash copy
forge test
```

### Deploying Your Contract

1. Compile your contract:

```bash copy
forge build
```

2. Deploy your contract to a local testnet (e.g., using Anvil, Foundry's local
   Ethereum node):

```bash copy
anvil -a 1
```

**Flags**

- `-a`: flag specifies the number of test accounts to create. This command
  will start a local Ethereum node and create one account. In the command
  output you will see created account and its private key. Use this private
  key to deploy your contract.

In a new terminal, deploy your contract:

```bash copy
forge create --rpc-url http://localhost:8545 --private-key <test_account_private_key> src/MyNFT.sol:MyNFT --legacy
```

**Flags**

- `--rpc-url`: flag to specify the URL of the Ethereum node. In this case,
  it's the URL of the local Anvil node.
- `--private-key`: flag to specify the private key of the account that will
  deploy the contract. Anvil generated test account's private key is used in
  this case.

3. Deploy contract to the Sei devnet (EVM endpoint):

```bash copy
forge create --rpc-url https://evm-rpc.arctic-1.seinetwork.io/ --private-key <your_private_key> src/MyNFT.sol:MyNFT --legacy
```

**Flags**

- `--rpc-url`: flag to specify the URL of the Ethereum node. In this case,
  it's the Sei EVM devnet URL.
- `--private-key`: flag to specify the private key of the account that will
  deploy the contract. The private key of your account on the Sei devnet is
  used in this case.

### Interacting With Your NFT

- You can interact with your deployed NFT contract using Foundry's `cast` tool
  or through other tools like Ethers.js in a script or web application.

### Create Pointer Contract

To enable seamless use of this NFT contract in the Cosmos environment, you can
create a pointer contract. This process results in an CW721 token that can be
imported and used in Sei wallets and applications.

```bash copy
seid tx evm register-cw-pointer ERC721 $ERC721_TOKEN_ADDRESS --from $ACCOUNT --chain-id=arctic-1 --fees=25000usei --node=https://rpc-arctic-1.sei-apis.com/
```

**Parameters**

- `ERC721_TOKEN_ADDRESS`: The contract address of the ERC721 token you want to
  create an CW721 pointer for.

**Flags**

- `--from`: The Sei address from which the deployment transaction is sent. This
  address must have enough balance to cover transaction fees.
- `--label`: A name for the contract instance used to identify the contract.
- `--chain-id`: Identifies the specific chain of the Sei network you're
  interacting with. `arctic-1` refers to the Sei devnet.
- `--broadcast-mode`: Determines how the transaction is broadcasted. Setting
  this to `block` means the transaction will wait to be included in a block
  before returning a response.
- `--gas`: Specifies the maximum amount of gas that can be consumed by the
  transaction.
- `--fees`: Indicates the transaction fee.
- `--node`: Points to the specific Sei node RPC URL you're connecting to for
  transaction submission.
- `--no-admin`: Specifies that the contract should not have an admin. This flag
  is used to indicate that the contract, once deployed, cannot be upgraded or
  migrated.

Executing this command creates an CW721 NFT contract and outputs the contract
address. This NFT contract is linked to the ERC721 NFT contract, meaning any
activities involving CW721 NFTs will also reflect on the state of the ERC721
NFTs and vice versa.
