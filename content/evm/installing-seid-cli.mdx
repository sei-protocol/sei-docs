# Installing seid CLI

## What is seid CLI?

The `seid` CLI is the command-line tool for interacting with the Sei blockchain. It allows you to manage wallets, send transactions, query network data, and perform validator operations.

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.23+: Installation instructions are available [here](https://go.dev/doc/install).

## Installation

To install seid, locate the version you wish to use [here](https://github.com/sei-protocol/sei-chain/releases). A list of the currently used versions on mainnet and testnet are displayed right below.

<div id="binary-versions" className="w-full mt-4 mb-6 px-1">
  <div className="overflow-hidden rounded-lg border border-neutral-200 dark:border-neutral-800">
    <VersionTable showGenesis={false} />
  </div>
</div>

Then, execute the following commands with the version that you picked:

```bash copy
git clone https://github.com/sei-protocol/sei-chain
cd sei-chain
git checkout [VERSION]
make install
```

You can verify that seid was installed correctly by running:

```bash copy
seid version
```

## Troubleshooting Installation

<Callout type="warning">If you encounter an error like `command not found: seid`, you may need to set your GOPATH environment variable.</Callout>

- Use `go env GOPATH` to find your GOPATH
- Add the following lines to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:

```bash copy
export GOPATH=[your GOPATH from step 1]
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
```

For more information see [here](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-GOPATH_environment_variable).

```

## Adding a Wallet

You can create a new wallet using the seid keys command:

```bash copy
seid keys add $NAME
```

Output:

```bash
- name: [YOUR_KEY_NAME]
  type: local
  address: sei1[GENERATED_ADDRESS]
  evm_address: ""
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"[PUBLIC_KEY]"}'
  mnemonic: ""

**Important** write this mnemonic phrase in a safe place.
It is the only way to recover your account if you ever forget your password.

[YOUR_24_WORD_MNEMONIC_PHRASE]

```

<Callout type="info">Please replace `$NAME` with the name you would like to use for this key. This will generate a seed phrase and store the account in the CLI for use.</Callout>

<Callout type="error">**Important**: Write this mnemonic down and store it in a safe place. Never share your seed phrase with anyone.</Callout>

Alternatively, if you would like to import an existing seed phrase, you can add the `--recover` flag:

```bash copy
seid keys add $NAME --recover
```

Output:

This will prompt you to enter your seed phrase, allowing you to import an existing wallet into the CLI.

```bash
> Enter your bip39 mnemonic
[ENTER_YOUR_EXISTING_MNEMONIC_PHRASE_HERE]

- name: [YOUR_WALLET_NAME]
  type: local
  address: sei1[RECOVERED_ADDRESS]
  evm_address: ""
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"[PUBLIC_KEY]"}'
  mnemonic: ""
```

## EVM Wallet Compatibility

### Understanding Coin Types

Sei supports two coin types:

- Coin type 118 (default): Standard Cosmos address format
- Coin type 60: Ethereum-compatible address format for EVM wallets

### Creating an EVM-Compatible Wallet

To create a new wallet that's compatible with EVM wallets like MetaMask:

```bash
seid keys add $NAME --coin-type=60
```

Output:

```bash
- name: [YOUR_KEY_NAME]
  type: local
  address: sei1[GENERATED_ADDRESS]
  evm_address: ""
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"[PUBLIC_KEY]"}'
  mnemonic: ""

**Important** write this mnemonic phrase in a safe place.
It is the only way to recover your account if you ever forget your password.

[YOUR_24_WORD_MNEMONIC_PHRASE]

```

### Importing an Existing EVM Wallet

To import an existing wallet from MetaMask or other EVM wallets:

```bash
seid keys add $NAME --coin-type=60 --recover
```

Output:

```bash
> Enter your bip39 mnemonic
> [ENTER_YOUR_EXISTING_MNEMONIC_PHRASE_HERE]

- name: [YOUR_WALLET_NAME]
  type: local
  address: sei1[RECOVERED_ADDRESS]
  evm_address: ""
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"[PUBLIC_KEY]"}'
  mnemonic: ""
```

You'll be prompted to enter your existing 12 or 24-word mnemonic phrase.

<Callout type="info">Use coin type 60 when you want to use the same address across EVM-compatible chains or import from MetaMask. Use the default coin type 118 for standard Cosmos operations.</Callout>

## Managing Wallets

To see your local wallets, you can run:

```bash copy
seid keys list
```

Output:

```bash
- name: [YOUR_WALLET_NAME]
  type: local
  address: sei1[WALLET_ADDRESS]
  evm_address: [EVM_ADDRESS]
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"[PUBLIC_KEY]"}'
  mnemonic: ""
  ...
```

to see a list of all wallets added, or

```bash copy
seid keys show $NAME
```

Output:

```bash
- name: [YOUR_WALLET_NAME]
  type: local
  address: sei1[WALLET_ADDRESS]
  evm_address: [EVM_ADDRESS]
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"[PUBLIC_KEY]"}'
  mnemonic: ""
```

to see details about a specific wallet.

## Deleting Wallets

To delete a wallet/key, you can use the following command:

```bash copy
seid keys delete $NAME
```

Output:

```bash
Key reference will be deleted. Continue? [y/N]: y
Key deleted forever (uh oh!)
```

This will remove the specified wallet from your local keyring. Be cautious, as this action cannot be undone.

## Uninstalling seid

If you need to remove `seid` from your system, you can delete the binary from your `$GOPATH/bin` directory:

```bash copy
rm $(go env GOPATH)/bin/seid
```
