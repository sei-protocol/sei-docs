# CosmWasm Precompile

**Address**: `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001002`

This precompile serves as an interface to the CosmWasm module, enabling EVM
based clients and smart contracts to interact with CosmWasm contracts directly.

## Functions

### Transactions

- `instantiate`: Instantiates a new CosmWasm contract

**Payable**: Any Sei amounts used to instantiate must be sent to the contract
directly. Use the `coins` field for other params.

```solidity copy
/// Instantiates a new CosmWasm contract.
/// @param codeID The codeID of the contract.
/// @param admin The Sei address of the account to be set as contract admin.
/// @param msg The msg to send for instantiation. The format is specified by the contract code.
/// @param label Any labels to include for the new contract.
/// @param coins Any non-sei denominations that the contract requires for instantiation.
/// @return The contract address and associated data.
function instantiate(
    uint64 codeID,
    string memory admin,
    bytes memory msg,
    string memory label,
    bytes memory coins
) payable external returns (string memory contractAddr, bytes memory data);
```

- `execute`: Sends a message to a CosmWasm contract for execution

**Payable**: Any Sei amounts required for contract execution must be sent to the
contract directly. Use the `coins` field for other params.

```solidity copy
/// Executes some message on a CosmWasm contract.
/// @param contractAddress The Sei address of the contract to execute.
/// @param msg The msg to send for execution. The format is specified by the contract code.
/// @param coins Any non-sei denominations that the contract requires for execution.
/// @return The execution response from the CosmWasm contract.
function execute(
    string memory contractAddress,
    bytes memory msg,
    bytes memory coins
) payable external returns (bytes memory response);
```

- `execute_batch`: Sends a messages to a CosmWasm contract for execution

**Payable**: Any Sei amounts required for contract execution must be sent to the
contract directly. Use the `coins` field for other params.

```solidity copy
struct ExecuteMsg {
    string contractAddress;
    bytes msg;
    bytes coins;
}
/// Executes collection of messages on a CosmWasm contract.
/// @param executeMsgs The Sei address of the contract to execute.
/// @return The execution responses collection from the CosmWasm contract.
function execute_batch(
    ExecuteMsg[] memory executeMsgs
) payable external returns (bytes[] memory responses);
```

### Queries

- `query`: Queries a CosmWasm contract state
  ```solidity copy
  /// Queries a CosmWasm contract.
  /// @param contractAddress The Sei address of the contract to query.
  /// @param req The query request object. The format is specified by the contract code.
  /// @return The response from the CosmWasm contract.
  function query(
      string memory contractAddress,
      bytes memory req
  ) external view returns (bytes memory response)
  ```
