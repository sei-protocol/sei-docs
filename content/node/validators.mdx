# Validator Operations Guide

This document covers the complete lifecycle of a validator node, from initial setup through ongoing operations and maintenance. Understanding these concepts is crucial for maintaining a reliable and secure validator operation.

## Understanding Validator Responsibilities

A validator in the Sei network serves several critical functions. As a validator, you are responsible for:

- Participating in consensus by proposing and validating blocks
- Maintaining high uptime and performance to avoid slashing
- Running a price feeder to provide oracle data (refer to the [Oracle Price Feeder Guide](./oracle-pricefeeder) for complete setup instructions)
- Managing delegator relationships and maintaining transparent operations
- Participating in governance and network upgrades

## Initial Setup

### Key Management

The security of your validator begins with proper key management. Your validator requires several distinct keys:

```bash copy
# Validator consensus key - Used for signing blocks
seid tendermint show-validator

# Operator key - Used for managing validator operations
seid keys add operator
```

These keys serve different purposes and should be managed with appropriate security measures. The consensus key, stored in `priv_validator_key.json`, is particularly critical as it's used to sign blocks and could result in slashing if compromised or mishandled.

### Hardware Security Module (HSM) Integration

For production validators, using an HSM is strongly recommended to protect your consensus key. Here's how to configure an HSM with your validator:

<details>
<summary>HSM Configuration Steps</summary>

```bash copy
# Install required libraries
sudo apt-get install opensc pkcs11-utils

# Configure YubiHSM2
yubihsm-connector -d

# Generate key in HSM
yubihsm-shell

# Configure seid to use HSM
tee "$HOME/.sei/config/priv_validator_config.json" << EOF
{
    "chain_id": "sei-chain",
    "key_type": "yubihsm",
    "state_file": "$HOME/.sei/data/priv_validator_state.json",
    "hsm_serial": "YOUR_HSM_SERIAL",
    "hsm_key_id": "YOUR_KEY_ID"
}
EOF
```

</details>

### Validator Registration

Before registering your validator, ensure your node is fully synced with the network. The creation of a validator is a crucial step that requires careful consideration of commission parameters:

```bash copy
seid tx staking create-validator \
    --amount=1000000usei \
    --pubkey=$(seid tendermint show-validator) \
    --moniker="choose_moniker" \
    --chain-id=sei-chain \
    --commission-rate="0.10" \
    --commission-max-rate="0.20" \
    --commission-max-change-rate="0.01" \
    --min-self-delegation="1" \
    --gas="auto" \
    --gas-adjustment="1.5" \
    --gas-prices="0.01usei" \
    --from=operator
```

The commission parameters require strategic consideration:

- `commission-rate`: Your initial commission rate, which should be competitive while ensuring operational sustainability
- `commission-max-rate`: An upper limit that can never be exceeded, setting a permanent cap on your commission
- `commission-max-change-rate`: Maximum daily commission change, limiting how quickly you can adjust rates

## Monitoring and Alerting

**Please refer to the [Advanced Operations](./advanced-config-monitoring) section for details around monitoring + alerting for your validator, price feeder and other nodes.**

## Security Practices

### Network Security

Validators may choose to implement a sentry node architecture to protect the block signing node (the validator). This setup helps prevent DDoS attacks on your validator node by creating a layer of defensive proxies:

```bash copy
# Validator node config.toml
[p2p]
pex = false
persistent_peers = "sentry_node_id@sentry_node_ip:26656"
private_peer_ids = ""
addr_book_strict = false

# Sentry node config.toml
[p2p]
pex = true
persistent_peers = "validator_node_id@ip:port"
private_peer_ids = "validator_node_id"
addr_book_strict = true
#optionsl
unconditional_peer_ids = "validator_node_id"
```

### Key Management Practices

Implement secure key backup procedures. Remember to choose the storage media carefully! Mechanical / flash based storage can fail unexpectedly, and cloud storage should **never** be used.

By default, the wallet key files are stored in your `/.sei` directory root, and the signer/consensus key in `/.sei/config`. Not only the `priv_validator_key.json`, but the wallet `.info` and `.address` file should also be saved.

Example script to encrypt backups of key files:

<details>
<summary>Key Backup Script</summary>

```bash copy
#!/bin/bash
# Create encrypted backup of validator keys
BACKUP_DIR="/secure/validator/backup"
DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Backup validator key
tar czf - $HOME/.sei/config/priv_validator_key.json | \
    gpg --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256 \
    -o $BACKUP_DIR/validator_key_$DATE.tar.gz.gpg

# Backup keyring
tar czf - $HOME/.sei/keyring-file | \
    gpg --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256 \
    -o $BACKUP_DIR/keyring_$DATE.tar.gz.gpg

# Create SHA256 checksums
sha256sum $BACKUP_DIR/*.gpg > $BACKUP_DIR/checksums_$DATE.txt
```

</details>

## Maintenance Procedures

### Planned Maintenance

When performing planned maintenance, to minimize potential impact:

- Notify delegators (recommended at least 24h in advance)

Consider posting to:

- Shared development team/validators comms channels
- Social media channels
- Validator website

Don't forget to stop the service!

```bash copy
# Gracefully stop the node
sudo systemctl stop seid

# Perform maintenance tasks

# Restart services
sudo systemctl start seid
```

### Emergency Procedures

Create and maintain an emergency response plan for various scenarios:

#### Consult with your fellow validators or a member of the Sei Labs or Foundation team directly for advice

## Governance Participation

As a validator, active participation in governance is required. Governance is the primary tool with which adjustments t0 various chain parameters are made.
Another critical role for validators is to review, and ultimately approve or reject proposed software upgrades to the network.

Governance proposals may be submitted by anyone willing to provide the mandatory (refundable) deposit, and can be voted on by any network user. Only votes by accounts delegating $SEI at the end of the voting period for a given proposal will be given weight.

Proposals currently on chain can be queried at any given time:

```bash copy
# List active proposals
seid query gov proposals --status voting_period

# Vote on a proposal
seid tx gov vote 1 yes \
    --from operator \
    --chain-id sei-chain \
    --gas auto \
    --gas-prices 0.01usei
```

## Recovery Procedures

### Critical Warning: Double-Signing Prevention

<Callout type="error">Double-signing is a severe violation that results in permanent validator tombstoning (irreversible jailing).</Callout>

Never run your validator keys on more than one machine simultaneously. If your primary validator goes offline:

1. DO NOT start another validator with the same keys
2. Either recover the original machine or properly migrate keys with absolute certainty the original is offline
3. If unsure about the state of your original validator, seek support before proceeding

The safe approach to recovery is:

1. Diagnose why the original validator is offline
2. If the original validator cannot be recovered, verify it is completely offline and powered down
3. Only then proceed with key migration to a new machine

### Validator Recovery

When you need to recover your validator on a new machine, follow these steps carefully:

```bash copy
# 1. Set up new machine with Sei node
# 2. Copy secured backup files
# 3. Restore validator key
gpg -d validator_key_backup.tar.gz.gpg | tar xzf -
# 4. Restore keyring
gpg -d keyring_backup.tar.gz.gpg | tar xzf -
# 5. Start services
sudo systemctl start seid
```

After recovery, verify your validator's status and performance:

```bash copy
# Check validator status
seid status
# Verify signing is working
seid query slashing signing-info $(seid tendermint show-validator)
```

This guide provides a foundation for operating a Sei validator. Remember that validator operation requires constant attention to security, performance, and network participation. Stay engaged with the Sei community and keep updated with network developments.
