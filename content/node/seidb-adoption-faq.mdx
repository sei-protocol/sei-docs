# SeiDB Adoption FAQ

SeiDB is the database layer designed to improve state storage performance on Sei. Use this FAQ to decide when and how to enable it.

## Why SeiDB?

<KeyValueTable
  rows={[
    ['Faster state reads', 'Optimized column families reduce latency for RPC-heavy workloads.'],
    ['Compact storage', 'Built-in pruning keeps disk usage predictable.'],
    ['Operator tooling', 'Supports snapshots and state sync workflows already used in production.']
  ]}
/>

## Prerequisites

- Run the latest binary that includes the SeiDB integration (see repository release notes).
- Ensure disk I/O can handle compacted writes (NVMe recommended).
- Backup your existing `data/` directory before enabling.

## Enable Steps

1. Stop the node.
2. Update `app.toml`:

   ```toml copy
   [state-store]
   ss-enable = true
   ss-backend = "seidb"
   ss-keep-recent = 100000
   ss-prune-interval = 600
   ```

3. Restart the node and monitor logs for `seidb` initialization messages.

## Migration Considerations

- First start performs data migration. Expect higher CPU and disk usage.
- Keep a recent snapshot handy; if migration encounters issues, you can roll back.
- After migration, take a fresh snapshot for disaster recovery.

## Monitoring

- Track disk utilization and compaction stats from logs.
- Monitor snapshot creation time; SeiDB should reduce snapshot size compared to RocksDB.

## Troubleshooting

<TroubleshootingTable
  rows={[
    ['Node fails to start with seidb references', 'Binary or config mismatch.', 'Ensure binary includes SeiDB support and `ss-backend` is spelled correctly.'],
    ['Increased CPU usage after enablement', 'Initial compaction running.', 'Allow compaction to finish; schedule enabling during low-traffic periods.'],
    ['Snapshots take longer than expected', 'Snapshot interval too short or disk under-powered.', 'Increase `ss-prune-interval` and run on faster storage.']
  ]}
