# Sei Oracle Price Feeder

## Overview

The Sei Oracle Price Feeder is a mandatory component for validators in networks utilizing the Sei oracle module. It ensures accurate and timely exchange rate data submission by fetching real-time market prices, aggregating data across multiple providers, and submitting periodic on-chain votes following network specifications.

Failure to maintain an active price feeder results in validator jailing and slashing due to missing oracle votes. The system expects consistent vote broadcasts within each oracle vote period.

## Core Functionality

The price feeder relies on several key processes:

1. Price Data Collection

   - Queries multiple supported exchanges for real-time market data
   - Processes raw price data through cleaning and aggregation pipelines
   - Applies deviation thresholds to filter outliers

2. Vote Construction and Submission

   - Monitors on-chain oracle parameters for vote timing
   - Creates and signs MsgAggregateExchangeRateVote messages
   - Broadcasts transactions via configured endpoints

3. Health Monitoring
   - Exposes metrics and health check endpoints
   - Integrates with external monitoring services
   - Provides real-time price data access

## Setup

### Installing the Binary

```bash copy
cd sei-chain
make install-price-feeder
```

This compiles and copies the price-feeder binary to /usr/local/bin/.

### Account Configuration

Create and configure a dedicated feeder account to prevent sequence errors and enhance security:

```bash copy
# Create feeder account
seid keys add price-feeder-delegate
export PRICE_FEEDER_DELEGATE_ADDR=$(seid keys show -a price-feeder-delegate)

# Assign feeder to validator
seid tx oracle set-feeder $PRICE_FEEDER_DELEGATE_ADDR --from <validator-wallet> \
    --fees 2000usei -b block -y --chain-id sei-chain

# Fund feeder account
seid tx bank send <validator-wallet> $PRICE_FEEDER_DELEGATE_ADDR 1000000usei \
    --fees=2000usei -b block -y
```

### Automatic Signing

```bash copy
export PRICE_FEEDER_PASS=<your_password>
```

For systemd services, add this environment variable to the [Service] section.

## Configuration Details

The price feeder uses a single TOML configuration file that defines all operational parameters. Let's examine each major component:

### Configuration Section Explanations

1. Root Level Settings

   - The gas_adjustment value of 1.5 provides a 50% buffer above estimated gas requirements
   - gas_prices defines the fee denomination and amount
   - enable_server activates the HTTP metrics endpoint
   - enable_voter controls price voting participation

2. Server Configuration

   - listen_addr determines the network interface and port for metrics
   - Timeout settings control request handling durations
   - verbose_cors enables detailed access logging

3. Price Data Settings

   - deviation_thresholds prevent outlier prices from affecting aggregation
   - currency_pairs define trading pairs, on-chain denominations, and data sources
   - provider_endpoints specify exchange API connection details

4. Chain Integration

   - account settings link to your validator and network
   - keyring configuration manages transaction signing
   - rpc settings enable chain communication

5. Monitoring
   - telemetry enables Prometheus metric collection
   - healthchecks integrate with external monitoring
   - Both systems help prevent missed votes
