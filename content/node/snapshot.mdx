# Join the testnet and mainnet network using Node Snapshots

<Callout type="warning">Before you resync a node using snapshots, make sure that in case of a successfull resync that you _under no circumstance_ cannot double sign blocks at previous heights with your validator. Failure to do so will cause tombstoning of your validator.</Callout>

Follow this guide to join an existing network through **snapshot sync**. To quickly spin up a fresh full node and join the network, it's recommended to restore from a snapshot instead of replaying all historical blocks.

## Snapshot Sync

Snapshot sync allows a new node to join a network by downloading a recent, compressed copy of the entire application state (including the `wasm` folder) and extracting it directly into the data directory. This reduces the initial sync time from days to minutes.

Two community‑maintained sources provide reliable snapshots:

- **Polkachu periodic snapshots** – lightweight node snapshots for both mainnet and testnet, published several times a day.
- **CryptoCrew full archive snapshots** – complete, genesis‑to‑tip archives for operators who need the full transaction history.

Choose the option that best fits your storage and indexing needs.

## Clean Up

If you are **not** starting a node from fresh, perform the following backups and clean‑ups first.

<Callout type="info">Note: This step is not needed for fresh nodes.</Callout>

Assuming your sei home directory is `$HOME/.sei`, back up `priv_validator_key.json` and `priv_validator_state.json`:

```bash
cp $HOME/.sei/data/priv_validator_state.json $HOME/priv_validator_state.json
cp $HOME/.sei/config/priv_validator_key.json $HOME/priv_validator_key.json
```

Reset the state:

```bash
seid tendermint unsafe-reset-all --home $HOME/.sei
```

Finally, remove the existing data and wasm folders and restore the `priv_validator_state.json`:

```bash
rm -rf $HOME/.sei/data/\*
rm -rf $HOME/.sei/wasm
cp $HOME/priv_validator_state.json $HOME/.sei/data/priv_validator_state.json
```

# Download & Restore a Snapshot

## Option 1 — Polkachu (recommended for most operators)

### Prerequisites

```bash
sudo apt install lz4 wget
```

### Stop the daemon

```bash
sudo systemctl stop seid
```

### Download and extract snapshot

First, get the latest snapshot height from Polkachu:

- **Mainnet**: [Polkachu Mainnet Snapshots](https://www.polkachu.com/tendermint_snapshots/sei)
- **Testnet**: [Polkachu Testnet Snapshots](https://www.polkachu.com/testnets/sei/snapshots)

Set the HEIGHT variable with the latest snapshot height:

```bash
HEIGHT=<LATEST_HEIGHT_FROM_POLKACHU>
```

Then set the snapshot URL based on your network:

For **Mainnet**:

```bash
SNAP_URL="https://snapshots.polkachu.com/snapshots/sei/sei_${HEIGHT}.tar.lz4"
```

For **Testnet**:

```bash
SNAP_URL="https://snapshots.polkachu.com/testnet-snapshots/sei/sei_${HEIGHT}.tar.lz4"
```

Download & extract:

```bash
wget -O sei_snapshot.tar.lz4 $SNAP_URL --inet4-only
lz4 -c -d sei_snapshot.tar.lz4 | tar -x -C $HOME/.sei
```

Restore validator state if you backed it up:

```bash
cp $HOME/.sei/priv_validator_state.json $HOME/.sei/data/priv_validator_state.json
```

Restart the daemon:

```bash
sudo systemctl start seid
```

Optional: Remove the snapshot file

```bash
rm sei_snapshot.tar.lz4
```

## Option 2 — CryptoCrew Full Archive

### Prerequisites

```bash
sudo apt install wget lz4
```

### Stop the daemon

```bash
sudo systemctl stop seid
```

### Download and stream extract

Find the latest archive from Cryptocrew here and find the height of the snapshot that you want to sync to:
https://github.com/cryptocrew-validators/CryptoCrew-Validators/blob/main/chains/sei/service_Archive_Snapshot.md

Set this height as parameter:

```bash
height=<HEIGHT_NUMBER>
```

Then, set your ARCH:

```bash
ARCH_URL="https://dl-eu2.ccvalidators.com/SNAPSHOTS/archive/sei/pacific-1_${height}.tar.lz4"
```

```bash
rm -rf $HOME/.sei/data
rm -rf $HOME/.sei/wasm
rm -rf $HOME/.sei/config/priv_validator_key.json
```

Stream‑extract the archive to save disk space:

```bash
wget -O - $ARCH_URL | lz4 -d | tar -xvf -
```

Restore validator state file:

```bash
rm data/priv_validator_state.json
mv ./priv_validator_state.json.tmp data/priv_validator_state.json
```

Restart the daemon:

```bash
sudo systemctl start seid
```

Both methods leave you with a fully‑synced node in minutes. Verify the node is catching up (`journalctl -fu seid -o cat`) and compare the reported block height against a public RPC endpoint or a block explorer.

## Troubleshooting snapshots

**Q:** I can't download a snapshot.

**A:** Try another time later as these snapshots are refreshed regularly and inform us in the [Sei Tech Chat](https://t.me/+KZdhZ1eE-G01NmZk)

**Q:** The snapshot finishes, but immediately get `AppHash` errors upon regular block sycing:

**A:** Make sure that you use the latest version of the node software.
