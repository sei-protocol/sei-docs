# IBC Relayer

## Overview

**Relayers** are permissionless off-chain processes that ferry data packets from
one chain to
another. [Relayer](https://www.ibcprotocol.dev/technical-resource-catalog?category=Relayer#results)s
scan chain states, build transactions based on these states, and submit the
transactions to the chains involved in the network. Relayers play a crucial role
in IBC because chains do not directly send messages to each other over
networking infrastructure. Instead, they create and store the data to be
retrieved and used by a relayer to build IBC packets.

Get an in-depth walkthrough of the IBC components and packet flow on
the [developer documentation.](https://ibc.cosmos.network/v8/ibc/overview)

There are several relayer implementations in different languages:

- Golang [relayer](https://github.com/cosmos/relayer)
- Rust [hermes](https://hermes.informal.systems/)

## Running relayer with Sei

### Installation

We will be using hermes as example relayer. Please note, that Sei requires
hermes of version `1.3.0` .

To install hermes simply head to the
GitHub [Releases](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/releases) page and
download Hermes binary matching your platform:

- macOS: `hermes-v1.3.0-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz` (or .zip),
- Linux: `hermes-v1.3.0-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz` (or .zip).

The step-by-step instruction below should carry you through the whole process:

1. Make the directory where we'll place the binary:

```sh copy
mkdir -p $HOME/.hermes/bin
```

2. Extract the binary archive:

```sh copy
tar -C $HOME/.hermes/bin/ -vxzf $ARCHIVE_NAME
```

3. Update your path, by adding this line in your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` shell
   configuration file:

```sh copy
export PATH="$HOME/.hermes/bin:$PATH"
```

The `Source code` [archive](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/archive/refs/tags/v1.3.0.tar.gz) also contains hermes documentation that you can follow in `guide/book` folder.

### Configuration

`$HOME/.hermes/config.toml` file should look like below. Please note that this example assumes local chains, so all RPC urls have to be substituted for real chain ones.

```toml copy
[global]
log_level = 'info'

[mode]

[mode.clients]
enabled = true
refresh = true
misbehaviour = true

[mode.connections]
enabled = true

[mode.channels]
enabled = true

[mode.packets]
enabled = true
clear_interval = 100
clear_on_start = true
tx_confirmation = true

[telemetry]
enabled = true
host = '127.0.0.1'
port = 3001

[[chains]]
id = 'ibc-0'
rpc_addr = 'http://localhost:27030'
grpc_addr = 'http://localhost:27032'
rpc_timeout = '15s'
account_prefix = 'cosmos'
key_name = 'wallet'
store_prefix = 'ibc'
gas_price = { price = 0.01, denom = 'stake' }
max_gas = 10000000
gas_multiplier = 1.5
clock_drift = '5s'
trusting_period = '14days'
trust_threshold = { numerator = '1', denominator = '3' }
event_source = { mode = 'push', url = 'ws://127.0.0.1:27030/websocket', batch_delay = '500ms' }

[[chains]]
id = 'sei-chain'
rpc_addr = 'http://localhost:26657'
grpc_addr = 'http://localhost:9090'
rpc_timeout = '15s'
account_prefix = 'sei'
key_name = 'wallet'
store_prefix = 'ibc'
gas_price = { price = 0.025, denom = 'usei' }
max_gas = 10000000
gas_multiplier = 2
clock_drift = '5s'
trusting_period = '14days'
trust_threshold = { numerator = '1', denominator = '3' }
event_source = { mode = 'push', url = 'ws://127.0.0.1:26657/websocket', batch_delay = '500ms' }
```

Next we need to add the account keys to hermes.

```bash copy
hermes keys add --key-name wallet --chain sei-chain --mnemonic-file $HOME/misc/mm_file_sei
hermes keys add --key-name wallet --chain ibc-0 --mnemonic-file $HOME/misc/mm_file_ibc_0
```

The contents of $HOME/misc/mm*file*\* file is just a seed phrase of the chain
account that will be associated with the chain.

Finally we need to create clients, connections and channel. There are separate
commands for that, but there is a simpler shortcut command:

```bash copy
hermes create channel --a-chain sei-chain --b-chain ibc-0 --a-port transfer --b-port transfer --new-client-connection
```

The output of this command should return created channel details.

Finally start relaying:

```bash copy
hermes start
```

Please note, that this tutorial is a simplified version. Running relayer in
production would require different level of effort, configuration and
monitoring.

For more information on hermes, please refer to the
[official 1.3 version documentation](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/archive/refs/tags/v1.3.0.tar.gz)
that can be found in the `guide/book` folder of the source code archive.
