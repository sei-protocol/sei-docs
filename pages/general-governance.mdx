Governance is a vital aspect of blockchains, enabling token holders to participate in decision-making processes that shape the future of the network. This section provides an overview of the governance process, how to vote, where to view votes, proposal timelines, voting options, and other essential information.

### Overview of Governance

Governance on the Sei blockchain allows token holders to propose, discuss, and vote on changes to the network. This decentralized approach ensures that the community has a say in important decisions, maintaining the network's integrity and alignment with the interests of its participants.

### Proposal Timelines

The governance process follows a structured timeline to ensure thorough discussion and consideration of each proposal.

1. **Proposal Submission**: Any token holder can submit a proposal by paying a deposit.
2. **Deposit Period**: The community has a specific period to add their deposits to the proposal. If the minimum deposit threshold is met, the proposal moves to the voting period.
3. **Voting Period**: Once the deposit period ends, the proposal enters the voting period, where token holders can cast their votes.
4. **Result Period**: After the voting period, the results are tallied and the outcome is determined.

### Voting Options

When a proposal enters the voting period, token holders have several voting options:

- **Yes**: Agree with the proposal.
- **No**: Disagree with the proposal.
- **No with Veto**: Strongly disagree with the proposal and request the deposit to be burned.
- **Abstain**: Choose not to vote either for or against the proposal but still participate in the governance process.

### Additional Information

- **Proposal Quorum**: For a proposal to be valid, it must reach a certain quorum, which is a minimum percentage of the total staked tokens that need to participate in the vote.
- **Proposal Types**: Proposals can range from parameter changes and software upgrades to community spend proposals and other governance-related matters.

Governance in the Sei blockchain empowers the community to actively participate in the network's development and evolution. By understanding the governance process and engaging in voting, token holders can influence the direction of the network and ensure it aligns with the community's vision and values.
