# About Sei

## What is Sei?

Sei is a general purpose, open-source Layer 1 blockchain specialized for the exchange of digital assets. Leveraging a novel consensus and technical breakthroughs, Sei is the fastest blockchain in the industry.

A common misconception is that Sei is a DeFi chain. However, the exchange of digital assets is universal across gaming, social, and NFTs. **Trading is general purpose**.

## What problem does Sei solve?

The fundamental use case of blockchains is the ability to exchange digital assets.

The most successful Web3 apps are:

1. Indirect trading apps (most Metamask users ultimately use Uniswap / OpenSea) or
2. Direct trading apps, disguised as a game or NFT marketplace (like Axie or Magic Eden).

There are major tailwinds driving the growth of on-chain trading and exchange of digital assets. As regulation increases on centralized exchanges, more activity flows on-chain. As crypto adoption increases, more assets are tokenized and the need to exchange these assets increases exponentially.

Exchanges face a major scaling problem on Layer 1s today. Exchanges face the **Exchange Trilemma**: between decentralization, scalability and capital efficiency, they cannot achieve all three.

Sei addresses the exchange scalability problem by building the first Layer 1 specialized for trading, optimizing every layer of the stack to offer the best infrastructure for the exchange of digital assets.

## What Sei offers

1. Sei is the fastest chain to finality - point blank - with a lower bound of 300ms
2. Twin-turbo consensus - achieves industry-leading performance
3. One of the only chains to conduct market-based parallelization
4. Native matching engine that exchange teams can leverage
5. Frontrunning protection - combats malicious frontrunning that is rampant in other ecosystems

Sei has only one value prop: exchange apps, whether they are NFT marketplaces or part of a gaming economy, will provide the best user experience when built on Sei.
