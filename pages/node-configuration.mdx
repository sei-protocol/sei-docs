# Node Configuration

## Node types
There are a few node types that can be run on Sei network which serve a variety of purposes. These include:

- **rpc / full nodes:** these nodes are generally used for querying data or interacting with the chain. They maintain
some state but not since genesis. The default settings will run rpc / full nodes.
- **archive nodes:** maintain full state of the blockchain from genesis. Generally requires large disks. To enable this
type of node, set `min-retain-blocks=0` and `pruning="nothing"` in your `app.toml`
- **state sync nodes:** provide snapshot data for other nodes to use to bootstrap onto the chain. To enable this type
of node, set `enable=true` under the `[statesync]` section in `config.toml`
- **validator nodes:** provide security to the chain by proposing and signing blocks. To enable this type of node, set
`mode=validator` in `config.toml`. Note that because Sei is proof-of-stake, you must have enough delegation to join the
active set


## Commonly Used Ports
Seid uses the following TCP ports. Toggle their settings to match your environment.

- `26656`: The default port for the P2P protocol. This port is used to communicate with other nodes and must be open to
join a network.
- `1317`: The default port for interacting with the Seid API server for HTTP RESTful requests. This allows applications
and services to interact with the `seid` instance through RPC.
- `26660`: The default port for interacting with the Prometheus database, which can be used to monitor the environment.
In the default configuration, this port is not open.
- `26657`: The default port for the RPC protocol. Because this port is used for querying and sending transactions, it
must be open for serving queries from `seid`.
- `8545`: The default port for the EVM RPC port. This allows applications and services to interact with EVM via HTTP
RESTful requests.
- `8546`: The default port for the EVM websocket port. This allows applications and services to interact with EVM via
websocket such as `wscat`

These ports are all customizable in `$HOME/.sei/config/config.toml` and `$HOME/.sei/config/app/toml` discussed in the later sections along with other fields.
