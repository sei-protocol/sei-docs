# Introduction

If you're an experienced blockchain user transitioning to Sei from other networks, one of your initial steps after setting up your Sei wallet would be to bridge assets from other blockchains. Sei currently facilitates bridging from these chains:

- Ethereum
- Solana
- Polygon
- Arbitrum
- BNB Smart Chain
- Osmosis
- Optimism

## Bridging Funds from Ethereum to Sei

Below is a step-by-step video guide on bridging funds to your Sei wallet from Ethereum. The process is similar for the other supported blockchains.
