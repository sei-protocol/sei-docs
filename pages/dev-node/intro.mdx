# Local Sei Node
In this guide, we'll walk you through how to set up the Sei blockchain locally on your machine.

## Prerequisites
To begin, ensure you are in the sei-chain repository on your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sei-protocol/sei-chain
cd sei-chain
```

## Running a Local Single-node Testnet
To run Sei locally, run the following command

```bash
./scripts/initialize_local_chain.sh
```

Once you run the initialization script, the seid process will be running 1 node locally. It will also seed 50 accounts. To verify the status of the local blockchain, open a new tab and run

```bash
seid status | jq
```

If the chain is running properly, you should see output similar to the following:

```bash

To deploy multiple nodes, you can use a docker container to start a sei chain cluster.

## Install Docker & Docker Compose
- For MacOS:
The easiest and recommended way to get Docker and Docker Compose is to install Docker Desktop here:

https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/

- For Ubuntu:
Follow the below link to install docker on ubuntu

https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository

Follow the below link to install standalone docker compose

https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/other/

## Deploy Sei Chain Validators on Docker
Detailed instructions and commands can be found in the Makefile of the sei-chain repo.

- Start a 4 Node Validator Cluster
This will start a 4 node sei chain cluster, each validator node will be running in its own docker container, and each node will also run the oracle price feeder daemon

#### If this is the first time or you want to rebuild the binary:
```bash
make docker-cluster-start
```

#### If you have run docker-cluster-start and build/seid exist,
#### you can skip the build process to quick start by:
```bash
make docker-cluster-start-skipbuild
```
All the logs and genesis files will be generated under the temporary build/generated folder. To access the service log:

### Monitor logs after cluster is started for node0
```bash
tail -f build/generated/logs/seid-0.log
```

SSH into a single validator node
### List all containers
docker ps -a
### SSH into a running container
docker exec -it [container_name] /bin/bash
Deploy a State Sync Node
Requirement: Follow the above steps to start a 4 node docker cluster before starting any state sync node.

### Be sure to start up a 4-node cluster before you start a state sync node
```bash
make docker-cluster-start
```

## Wait for at least a few minutes till the latest block height exceed 500 (this can be changed via app.toml)
```bash
seid status |jq
```

# Start up a state sync node
```bash
make run-rpc-nodesh
```

## Local Docker for Debugging and Testing
One of the fanciest thing of using docker is fast iteration. Here we support:

Being able to make changes locally and start up the chain to see the immediate impact
Being able to make changes to local dependency repo (Cosmo SDK/Tendermint) and start the chain with the latest changes without bumping or release any binary version In order to make local debugging work, you can follow these steps:

#### Clone your dependency repo and put them under the same path as sei-chain
```bash
cd sei-chain
cd ../
git clone https://github.com/sei-protocol/sei-tendermint.git
git clone https://github.com/sei-protocol/sei-cosmos.git
```

#### Modify go.mod file to point to local repo, must use the exact same path as below:
cd sei-chain
```bash
go mod edit -replace github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk=../sei-cosmos
go mod edit -replace github.com/tendermint/tendermint=../sei-tendermint
```

## Start the docker cluster
make docker-cluster-start
#### You are good to go now! Make changes as you wish to any of the dependency repo and run docker to test it out.
