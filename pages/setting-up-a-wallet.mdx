# Setting up a Wallet

## Installing a Wallet

You can navigate Sei with any of the following wallets:

**EVM Only**

- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)

**EVM & CosmWasm Compatible**

- [Compass](https://compasswallet.io/)

For more wallet options, please visit our registry [here](https://github.com/sei-protocol/chain-registry/tree/main).

  **Caution:** Importing your wallet from an EVM-only wallet to a
  dual-compatible wallet, or vice versa, may result in a different address.

## Switching Networks

For EVM-only wallet users, adding the Sei EVM Network is a breeze. Click the button below to connect your wallet and import:
