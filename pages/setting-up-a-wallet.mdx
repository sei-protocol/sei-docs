# Setting up a Wallet

## Installing a Wallet

You can navigate Sei with any of the following wallets:

**EVM Only**

- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)

For more wallet options, please visit our registry [here](https://github.com/sei-protocol/chain-registry/blob/main/wallets.json).

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  **Caution:** Importing your wallet from an EVM-only wallet to a native Sei
  wallet, or vice versa, may result in a different address.
</Callout>

## Switching Networks

For EVM-only wallet users, adding the Sei EVM Network is a breeze. Click the button below to connect your wallet and import:

<EvmWalletConnect />

## Wallet Addresses

Every account has a unique public key. In Sei V2, this public key translates into two different types of addresses: one for the EVM world and another for the SEI world.

<ImageWithCaption img={addressTranslationImage} alt="Address derivation" />

- **EVM Address**: This address starts with `0x` and works with Ethereum-based activities.

- **SEI Address**: This address starts with `sei` and works with Sei-native activities.

Although these addresses seem different, they actually share the same account underneath. This means whatever you do with one address will also reflect on the other. If you put money into your EVM address, you can see and use that same money with your SEI address, and vice versa. They are linked together as one account.

<Callout type="info">
  Your EVM and Sei address will not be associated with each other until you send
  a transaction from your EVM address.
</Callout>
