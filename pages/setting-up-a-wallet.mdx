# Setting up a Wallet

## Installing a Wallet

You can navigate Sei with any of the following wallets:

**EVM Only**

- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)

For more wallet options, please visit our registry [here](https://github.com/sei-protocol/chain-registry/blob/main/wallets.json).

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  **Caution:** Importing your wallet from an EVM-only wallet to a native Sei
  wallet, or vice versa, may result in a different address.
</Callout>

## Switching Networks

For EVM-only wallet users, adding the Sei EVM Network is a breeze. Click the button below to connect your wallet and import:

<EvmWalletConnect />

## Wallet Addresses

Every account has a unique public key. In Sei V2, this public key translates into two different types of addresses: one for the EVM world and another for the SEI world.

- **EVM Address**: This address starts with `0x` and is used for Ethereum-based activities.

- **SEI Address**: This address starts with `sei` and is used for Sei-native activities.

Although these addresses appear different, they actually share the same underlying account. This means whatever action you take with one address will also affect the other. If you deposit funds into your EVM address, you can access and use those same funds with your SEI address, and vice versa. They are linked together as one account, ensuring seamless integration between the EVM and SEI ecosystems.

<Callout type="info">
  Your EVM and SEI addresses will not be associated with each other until you
  initiate a transaction from your EVM address.
