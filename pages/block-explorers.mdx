# Block Explorers

## What Is a Block Explorer?

Block explorers offer tools for viewing and interacting with the network including:

1. Transaction Tracking: View and track individual transactions on the blockchain. This includes information such as transaction hashes, input and output data, amounts transferred and fees
2. Block Information: Provide detailed information about blocks, including block height, timestamp, size, and the transactions included in each block.
3. Address Queries: Look up specific wallet addresses to see their balances and transaction history
4. Network Statistics: Statistics and analytics about the blockchain network, such as the total number of blocks, transaction throughput, network hash rate, and current difficulty.
5. Smart Contract Interaction: Display information about smart contract deployments and interactions, including the code of the contract and executed actions.
