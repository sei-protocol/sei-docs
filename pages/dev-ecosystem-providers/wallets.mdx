# Wallets

Wallets are essential for managing assets and interacting with the Sei blockchain. There are various types of wallets available, each offering different features and levels of security.

## Types of Wallets

1. **Software Wallets**: These are applications or browser extensions that manage private keys and interact with the blockchain. They are easy to use and accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.
2. **Hardware Wallets**: These are physical devices that securely store private keys offline. They provide enhanced security but are less convenient for frequent transactions.
3. **Passkey-based Wallets**: These wallets use passkeys for authentication instead of traditional seed phrases, offering an additional layer of security.
