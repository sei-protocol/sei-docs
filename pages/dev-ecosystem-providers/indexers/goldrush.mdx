# GoldRush - powered by Covalent

[GoldRush](https://goldrush.dev/?utm_source=sei&utm_medium=partner-docs) is a set of data tools that enable easy web3 development acrossÂ [200+ supported blockchains](https://goldrush.dev/docs/networks/?utm_source=sei&utm_medium=partner-docs), 
including Sei mainnet (EVM only). The mission of GoldRush is to improve the lives of developers by providing structured onchain data for dapps.

Developers can utilize GoldRush via SDKs, APIs, UI Kits, human-readable transactions and pre-built templates for a number of web3 use cases. The GoldRush suite is powered by Covalent, which is decentralized and cryptographically secure. Whether you are fetching NFTs, DeFi transactions, or other onchain data, GoldRush helps scale hundreds of projects from crypto native teams to Fortune 500 companies.

With GoldRush, you have access to:

- Every wallet's token balances
- Full transaction histories
- Every contract log event

**Use GoldRush if you need:**

- Wallet, Transactions, NFT, DEX, Staking or core blockchain data (i.e. log events, blocks, gas)
- Normalized, aggregated and enhanced multichain data, well beyond what you get from RPC providers
- Enterprise-grade performance
