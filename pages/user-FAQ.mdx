## How do I find my EVM / 0x address from my current Sei address in Compass wallet?

Simply open compass wallet and click the "Receive" button, and you will see both your Sei and 0x (EVM) addresses available to copy. You can also visit the Sei app, which will tell you both EVM / 0x and Sei addresses - this works for other wallets too.
