# Connect to Sei

Welcome to Sei!

This getting started guide will help you set up your wallet and start using Sei, even if you're new to blockchain. By the end, you'll be ready to explore the most performant blockchain ever.

## Requirements

- A compatible, non-custodial wallet, such as [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), or [Compass](https://compasswallet.io/).
- Sei tokens [from an exchange](/onboard/getting-tokens), or stablecoins in your personal wallet.

For additional help with wallet apps, see our [Setting up a Wallet](/onboard/wallet-setup) guide.

## Connecting Your Wallet

For a quick setup, simply click the "Connect Wallet" button below to connect directly from this guide.

<EvmWalletConnect />

After connecting, your wallet will automatically prompt you to join the correct Sei network.

To try connecting within the Sei App itself, visit [app.sei.io](https://app.sei.io) and click the "Connect Wallet" button. If you're ready to dive in, the demo below walks you through connecting to the Sei network step-by-step.
> If your wallet doesn’t automatically prompt you to join the Sei Network, please add it manually by following the network details [here](/user-guides/wallet-setup).

## Dual Address Support

Sei supports two wallet address types:

- **EVM (0x) address:** Ethereum-style addresses prefixed with "0x".
- **Sei address:** Native Sei blockchain addresses prefixed with "sei1".

Both addresses are derived from the same public key, ensuring seamless asset integration across formats.
You can find your corresponding wallet addresses directly in the Sei app.

For more details on interoperability, explore our article [here](https://blog.sei.io/sei-v2-interoperability/).

### How to Link Your Addresses

<Callout emoji="💡">
    Linking addresses is recommended for all users to enable cross-VM functionality in many Sei apps.
</Callout>

To use interoperability features in Sei apps, you’ll need to link your Sei and EVM (0x) addresses. Each Sei address has a corresponding EVM address, derived from the same public key, and this link is required on your first use.

<Callout type="warning">
  Address linking is automatic—each Sei account is tied to a single Sei address and a single EVM address, both derived from the same public key.
</Callout>

Follow these steps to link your Sei and EVM addresses:

1. Go to [app.sei.io](https://app.sei.io) in your browser.
2. In the Dashboard, locate the "Addresses" box.
3. Complete any required captcha.
4. Click "Link Addresses" to start the process. You’ll be prompted to sign a message with your wallet—this is not a transaction and incurs no gas fees.
5. Once signed, your Sei and EVM addresses will be linked.

For more details, check the [Linking Addresses guide](/onboard/linking-addresses).

### How to View Your Address Pair

You can view your wallet address on any Sei blockchain explorer to see your transactions and balances.

Enter your Sei or EVM address below to view it on SEITRACE:

<SeiTraceSearch />

## Onboarding from Centralized Exchanges

If you're transitioning from a CEX, using both Sei and 0x addresses is simple. CEXs will upgrade to support both over time.

### Withdrawing to a Sei Address

Copy your **sei1...** address and paste it into the withdrawal page of your CEX.

<ImageWithCaption img={cexWithdrawImage} alt="Withdraw Sei from Cex"/>

<Callout type="warning">
    No memo is required for withdrawals, but depositing back to a CEX may require a memo. Check your CEX's guidelines to ensure smooth transfers.
</Callout>

### Withdrawing to an EVM/0x Address

To withdraw to an 0x address, you must first link it to your Sei address. Follow the steps in the [Linking Addresses guide](/user-guides/linking-addresses).

If your addresses aren't linked, visit the Dashboard on the [Sei App](https://app.sei.io) to check or link them.

## Bridging to Sei

To move assets to Sei from another network, find recommended bridge paths via the Sei app:

1. Go to [app.sei.io](https://app.sei.io).
2. Select the **Source Chain** (where your assets currently reside).
<ImageWithCaption img={sourceChainDropdownImage} alt="Select a source chain"/>
3. Choose the asset you want to bridge (e.g., stablecoins). Verify the token. 
<Callout emoji="⚠️">
    NB: Assets pictured are for illustrative purposes only and may not be supported at present. 
    Check the Sei app to see what options are available to you.
</Callout>
<ImageWithCaption img={selectAssetImage} alt="Select an asset"/>
4. The app will recommend a bridge based on the asset and origin chain.

We recommend [Squid](https://www.squidrouter.com/) for initial bridging. New bridges will be added over time.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    While bridge providers work to minimize risks, always conduct your own due diligence and research before 
    engaging in bridging.
</Callout>

### Gas on Arrival

Some bridges offer a "gas on arrival" feature, providing a small amount of Sei tokens to cover initial transaction fees. To find these options, open the Sei App, go to the "Bridge" section, select your source chain and asset, and view the recommended third-party bridges. Bridges with "gas on arrival" support are typically labeled in the app, making it easy to identify them. If no label appears, check the bridge provider's official documentation or website for the latest "gas on arrival" information.

## Viewing Assets in Your Wallet

To view your assets, use a block explorer like [seitrace.com](https://www.seitrace.com). 
This explorer supports both EVM and native Sei addresses.

Simply search for your wallet address to view your holdings. To import tokens into MetaMask, use the contract addresses found in the explorer. Learn more [here](https://support.metamask.io/managing-my-tokens/custom-tokens/how-to-display-tokens-in-metamask/).
