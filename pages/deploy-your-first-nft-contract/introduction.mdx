## What are NFTs?
NFT stands for Non-Fungible Token. Unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are fungible and can be
exchanged on a one-to-one basis, NFTs are unique digital assets. This uniqueness means that one NFT cannot be
exchanged on a like-for-like basis with another, making each NFT distinct and irreplaceable.

## Characteristics of NFTs
**Uniqueness and Scarcity:** Each NFT has a digital signature that makes it impossible for NFTs to be exchanged for or
equal to one another (hence, non-fungible). Artists can create a scarcity of their art by issuing a limited number of
NFTs.

**Ownership and Provenance:** NFTs can be used to represent ownership of a specific item. They contain built-in
authentication, which serves as proof of ownership. Collectors value those “digital bragging rights” almost more than
the item itself.

**Interoperability:** NFTs can be bought, sold, and traded across various platforms and marketplaces, as long as those
platforms support the same standards used to create the NFT (e.g., ERC-721 and ERC-1155 on the Ethereum blockchain).

## Use Cases of NFTs
- Digital Art: One of the most prominent uses of NFTs is in digital art. Artists can tokenize their work to sell it as
NFTs, which has opened a new market for digital creators.
- Collectibles: NFTs are being used for digital collectibles, such as digital trading cards or rare items in video
games.
- Music and Entertainment: Musicians and entertainers are using NFTs to tokenize their work, from albums to concert
tickets.

## How Do NFTs Work?
**Minting:** The process of creating an NFT is called minting. It involves uploading content to a blockchain network and
turning it into a part of the blockchain.

**Buying and Selling:** NFTs are typically bought and sold on specialized marketplaces. When you buy an NFT, you receive
a token that proves your ownership of a 'one-of-a-kind' piece of digital content.
