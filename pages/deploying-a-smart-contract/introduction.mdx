# Introduction

In this guide, we'll be going over how to deploy an NFT smart contract on Sei.

## What are NFTs?

NFT stands for Non-Fungible Token. Unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are fungible and can be
exchanged on a one-to-one basis, NFTs are unique digital assets. This uniqueness means that one NFT cannot be
exchanged on a like-for-like basis with another, making each NFT distinct and irreplaceable.

<div
  style={{
    marginTop: "2rem",
    display: "flex",
    justifyContent: "center",
    gap: "2rem",
    width: "100%",
  }}
>
  <Image src={colonyNFT} alt="colonyNFT" width={300} height={300} />
  <Image src={seiyanNFT} alt="seiyanNFT" width={300} height={300} />
</div>

## What is the objective of this tutorial?

When you complete this tutorial, you'll be able to deploy both NFTs and any smart contract you choose on Sei.
