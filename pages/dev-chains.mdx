## Chains

Sei operates three distinct chains, each serving different purposes: mainnet, testnet, and devnet. Below is an overview of each chain, including their purposes and chain IDs.

- #### **Mainnet**

The `pacific-1` chain is the mainnet of the Sei blockchain. It is the live, production environment where actual transactions and smart contract deployments occur. This chain is used for all real-world applications and activities involving Sei tokens.

- **Purpose**: Production environment for live applications.
- **Chain ID**: `pacific-1`
- **EVM Chain ID**: `1329` or `0x531`


- #### **Testnet**

The `atlantic-2` chain is the testnet of the Sei blockchain. It is used for testing and development purposes. Developers can deploy and test their dApps and smart contracts in a controlled environment that simulates the mainnet conditions. This chain is crucial for ensuring that applications work as expected before going live.

- **Purpose**: Testing and development environment.
- **Chain ID**: `atlantic-2`
- **EVM Chain ID**: `1328` or `0x530`


- #### **Devnet**

The `arctic-1` chain is the devnet of the Sei blockchain. It serves as a development network for early-stage testing and experimentation. This chain is typically used by developers to test new features, perform integration testing, and develop prototypes in an isolated environment.

- **Purpose**: Early-stage development and experimentation.
- **Chain ID**: `arctic-1`
- **EVM Chain ID**: `713715` or `0xAE3F3`

- #### **Local Chains**

Please read the [Nodes Introduction](/dev-node/intro) section for more information on how to set up and run a local chain.
