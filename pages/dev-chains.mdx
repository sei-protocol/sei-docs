## Chains

Sei operates three distinct chains, each serving different purposes: mainnet, testnet, and devnet. Below is an overview of each chain, including their purposes and chain IDs.

- #### **pacific-1 (Mainnet)**

The `pacific-1` chain is the mainnet of the Sei blockchain. It is the live, production environment where actual transactions and smart contract deployments occur. This chain is used for all real-world applications and activities involving Sei tokens.

- **Purpose**: Production environment for live applications.
- **Chain ID**: `pacific-1`

- #### **atlantic-2 (Testnet)**

The `atlantic-2` chain is the testnet of the Sei blockchain. It is used for testing and development purposes. Developers can deploy and test their dApps and smart contracts in a controlled environment that simulates the mainnet conditions. This chain is crucial for ensuring that applications work as expected before going live.

- **Purpose**: Testing and development environment.
- **Chain ID**: `atlantic-2`

- #### **arctic-1 (Devnet)**

The `arctic-1` chain is the devnet of the Sei blockchain. It serves as a development network for early-stage testing and experimentation. This chain is typically used by developers to test new features, perform integration testing, and develop prototypes in an isolated environment.

- **Purpose**: Early-stage development and experimentation.
- **Chain ID**: `arctic-1`

These three chains provide a comprehensive ecosystem for development, testing, and production deployment on the Sei blockchain. By using the appropriate chain for each stage of the development lifecycle, developers can ensure their applications are robust, secure, and ready for deployment.
