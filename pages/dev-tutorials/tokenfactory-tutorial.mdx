# Token Factory Tutorial

The `tokenfactory` module enables any account to create new tokens with a unique identifier based on the creator's address. Each account can generate multiple tokens by specifying distinct denoms. The token creator is granted "admin" privileges, allowing them to mint, burn, and transfer their token.

These tokens are named `factory/{CREATOR_ADDRESS}/{DENOM}` and come with a range of native functionalities.

## Requirements

To create a token on the devnet, ensure you have the following setup:

- The `seid` CLI
- A wallet with SEI tokens on devnet

<Callout type="info">
  You can obtain devnet tokens from one of the faucets listed
  [here](../dev-ecosystem-providers/faucets).
</Callout>

## Creating a Denom

```bash copy
seid tx tokenfactory create-denom $DENOM --from=$ACCOUNT --chain-id=arctic-1 --node=https://rpc.arctic-1.seinetwork.io/ --broadcast-mode=block --fees=20000usei
```

This command creates a new coin with the format `factory/{ACCOUNT}/{DENOM}`. Replace `$DENOM` with your desired denom name and `$ACCOUNT` with your account name. The account specified here will be the token admin.

<Callout>
Simplify your tutorial experience by setting the `$DENOM` and `$ACCOUNT` variables in your terminal. This allows you to easily refer to these variables throughout the tutorial.

For instance, to set a denom called `solid` and use the account name of your choice, use the following commands:

```bash code
DENOM=solid
ACCOUNT=your_account_name
```

Replace `your_account_name` with the actual name of your account. Once set, you can refer to these values throughout the session using `$DENOM` and `$ACCOUNT`.

</Callout>

### Understanding Command Line Arguments

When executing commands in this tutorial, you'll encounter several arguments. Here's a brief overview of what each means:

- `--chain-id=arctic-1`: This specifies the network where the command will be executed. In this case, `arctic-1` is the identifier for the Sei devnet.
- `--node=https://rpc.arctic-1.seinetwork.io/`: This points to the RPC URL of the node you are interacting with.
- `--broadcast-mode=block`: This determines how your transaction is broadcasted to the network. The `block` mode means the transaction will wait to be included in a block before returning a response. This is a safer option as it confirms your transaction is processed.
- `--fees=20000usei`: This is used to specify the transaction fee.

Understanding these arguments will help you execute the commands more confidently and customize them as needed for different scenarios.

## Updating Token Metadata

When creating a token, it is important to specify details regarding the denom amounts and aliases so your token can be correctly parsed on wallets and explorers.

### 1. Create Token Metadata file
Create a token metadata `json` file. The file below is an example metadata file for the Sei token.
```json
{
  "name": "sei",
  "description": "The native token of Sei.",
  "symbol": "SEI",
  "denom_units": [
    {
      "denom": "usei",
      "exponent": 0,
      "aliases": [
        "microsei"
      ],
    },
    {
      "denom": "msei",
      "exponent": 3,
      "aliases": [
        "millisei"
      ]
    },
    {
      "denom": "sei",
      "exponent": 6,
    }
  ],
  "base": "usei",
  "display": "sei",
}
```

The `base` field denotes the smallest denom that this token can be represented in.
Note that if you intend to create a [pointer contract](#create-pointer-contract), the `denom_units` with the largest exponent will be used as the display denom. (`sei` in this case).

### 2. Set token metadata using seid
```sh
seid tx tokenfactory set-denom-metadata $METADATA_FILE --fees 20000usei -b block -y --from $ADDR
```

Replace `$METADATA_FILE` with the path to your metadata file created in step 1. and `$ADDR` with the address of the token admin.

## Minting Tokens

```bash copy
seid tx tokenfactory mint $AMOUNT --from=$ACCOUNT --chain-id=arctic-1 --node=https://rpc.arctic-1.seinetwork.io/ --broadcast-mode=block --fees=20000usei
```

This command will create (mint) a specific `$AMOUNT` of your new token. Replace `$AMOUNT` with the number of tokens you want to mint, followed by the token denom generated from the previous command.

<Callout>
For instance, if you would like to mint 1M tokens, you should input `1000000factory/{ACCOUNT}/{DENOM}` as amount or you could set a new variable for the amount:

```bash
AMOUNT=1000000factory/${ACCOUNT}/${DENOM}
```

</Callout>

To verify that the tokens have been minted, query the balance of your account:

```bash copy
seid query bank balances $ACCOUNT --chain-id=arctic-1 --node=https://rpc.arctic-1.seinetwork.io/
```

## Burning Tokens

```bash copy
seid tx tokenfactory burn $AMOUNT --from=$ACCOUNT --chain-id=arctic-1 --node=https://rpc.arctic-1.seinetwork.io/ --broadcast-mode=block --fees=20000usei
```

This command allows you to burn a specific amount of your tokens, reducing the total supply. To use it, replace `$AMOUNT` with the number of tokens you wish to destroy.

<Callout>
For instance, to burn 100 tokens, you should input `100factory/{ACCOUNT}/{DENOM}`. Ensure that you substitute `{ACCOUNT}` and `{DENOM}` with your actual account address and token denomination, respectively. You can also update the variable:

```bash
AMOUNT=100factory/${ACCOUNT}/${DENOM}
```

</Callout>

Only the token admin has permission to mint and burn tokens. If necessary, you can reassign these privileges by using the `change-admin` command to designate a new admin.

## Create Pointer Contract

To enable seamless use of this token in EVM environments, we can create a pointer contract. This process results in an ERC20 token that can be imported and used in EVM wallets and applications.

```bash copy
seid tx evm register-evm-pointer NATIVE $DENOM --from=$ACCOUNT --fees 20000usei --evm-rpc=https://evm-rpc.arctic-1.seinetwork.io/
```

**Parameters**

- `DENOM`: The denomination of the token for which you want to create an ERC20 pointer. This should match the TokenFactory token you created.

**Flags**

- `--from`: The Sei address from which the deployment transaction is sent. This address must have enough balance to cover transaction fees.
- `--evm-rpc`: The endpoint URL for the EVM RPC interface of the Sei blockchain. This URL is used by the `seid` command to interact with the Sei EVM.

Executing this command creates an ERC20 token and outputs the contract address. This token is linked to the TokenFactory token, meaning any activities involving this ERC20 token will also reflect on the state of the TokenFactory token and vice versa.

Note that if you wish to specify denoms on your ERC20 tokens, you will need to [set the token metadata](#updating-token-metadata) for the base tokenfactory token. The denom with the largest exponent will be used.

## Next Steps

ðŸŽ‰ Congrats on completing the Token Factory tutorial! You've learned how to create, mint, and burn tokens on Sei using the `tokenfactory` module.

<Callout>
  Smart contracts can also create TokenFactory denoms and act as token admins,
  allowing for more complex and automated token management strategies.
