# Building a Frontend

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll demonstrate how to set up a frontend project using React. You'll learn how to connect to a Sei wallet and interact with EVM and CosmWasm smart contracts deployed on Sei.

Select one of the tabs below to get started!

<Tabs items={["EVM", "CosmWasm"]}>
<Tabs.Tab>
In this section, we'll explore Sei's unique interoperability features by building an EVM compatible DApp that interacts with a CosmWasm smart contract.
We will use [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/) to build a React app that interacts with a CosmWasm smart contract using the Sei [CosmWasm precompile](../dev-advanced-concepts/interoperability/precompiles/cosmwasm.mdx).

## Prerequisites
- Complete the tutorial in [cosmwasm-general](./cosmwasm-general.mdx) to deploy a CosmWasm counter contract on our devnet (arctic-1).

## Requirements

Before starting, ensure you have:

- Node.js & NPM installed
- One of the Sei wallets listed [here](../dev-ecosystem-providers/wallets.mdx)
- The wallet should be funded with sufficient Sei on our devnet (arctic-1). Refer to the section on [faucets](../dev-ecosystem-providers/faucets.mdx) for instructions on how to get Devnet tokens.

## Creating a React Project

Start by creating a new React project using Vite's TypeScript template for streamlined development:

```bash copy
npm create vite@latest my-counter-frontend -- --template react-ts
```

This command creates a new folder with a React project using TypeScript. Open `my-counter-frontend` in your favorite IDE.

<Callout type="info">
  The rest of this tutorial will be in TypeScript. If you're not using
  TypeScript, you can easily adjust by removing the types.
</Callout>

## Installing Dependencies

Install `ethers`, an Ethereum library that facilitates interaction with the Ethereum blockchain:

```bash copy
npm install ethers
```

## Defining Contract Addresses and ABI
In this tutorial, we will be using the **Wasm Precompile** to interact with our CosmWasm contract from the EVM.
Precompiles (short for Precompiled contracts) are EVM compatible contracts that are built into the chain. The Wasm Precompile is a unique smart contract on Sei that enables EVM clients to query and execute CosmWasm contracts.
Refer to the docs on [interoperability](../dev-advanced-concepts/interoperability/introduction) for more details about precompiles.

First, import the address and ABI of the CosmWasm precompile from `@sei-js/evm`.

<Callout type="info">
  `@sei-js` contains NPM libraries for writing applications that interact with
  Sei. Learn more [here](https://github.com/sei-protocol/sei-js/tree/main).
</Callout>

`@sei-js/evm` is an npm package that contains useful constants and helpers for interacting with the EVM on Sei.

To install sei-js:
```bash copy
npm install @sei-js/evm
```

At the top of `App.tsx` you can then import `WASM_PRECOMPILE_ADDRESS`, `WASM_PRECOMPILE_ABI`. These constants allow us to interact with the Wasm Precompile.

```tsx copy
import { WASM_PRECOMPILE_ADDRESS, WASM_PRECOMPILE_ABI, WasmPrecompileContract } from '@sei-js/evm';
import { ethers } from 'ethers';
```

These values will be used in the app to query and execute a contract.

## Connecting to the Wallet and Initializing the Contract

Replace your main `App` component with the following:

```tsx copy filename="App.tsx"
import { WASM_PRECOMPILE_ADDRESS, SeiChainInfo, getWasmPrecompileEthersV6Contract } from '@sei-js/evm';
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { BrowserProvider, Contract, toUtf8Bytes, toUtf8String } from "ethers";
import "./App.css";
 
function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState<string>();
  const [contract, setContract] = useState<Contract>();
  const [isIncrementing, setIsIncrementing] = useState(false);
 
  // TODO: Replace this with your CosmWasm contract address here
  const COUNTER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "sei14hj2tavq8fpesdwxxcu44rty3hh90vhujrvcmstl4zr3txmfvw9sh9m79m";
 
  const fetchCount = async () => {
    if (!contract) {
      return;
    }
    // Query to get the count on the counter contract
    const queryMsg = { get_count: {} };
    const queryResponse = await contract.query(
      COUNTER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
      toUtf8Bytes(JSON.stringify(queryMsg))
    );
    const { count } = JSON.parse(toUtf8String(queryResponse));
    setCount(count);
  };
 
  useEffect(() => {
    fetchCount();
  }, [contract]);
 
  const connectWallet = async () => {
    if (window.ethereum) {
      const provider = new BrowserProvider(window.ethereum);
      const { chainId } = await provider.getNetwork();
      const devnetChainId = SeiChainInfo.devnet.chainId
      if (chainId !== BigInt(devnetChainId)) {
        alert("Wallet is not connected to Sei EVM devnet");
        return;
      }
 
      const signer = await provider.getSigner();
      const contract = getWasmPrecompileEthersV6Contract(WASM_PRECOMPILE_ADDRESS, signer)

      setContract(contract);
    } else {
      alert("No EVM compatible wallet installed");
    }
  };
 
  const incrementCount = async () => {
    if (!contract) {
      return;
    }
 
    setIsIncrementing(true);
    // Execute message to increment the count on the contract
    const executeMsg = { increment: {} };
    const executeResponse = await contract.execute(
      COUNTER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
      toUtf8Bytes(JSON.stringify(executeMsg)),
      toUtf8Bytes(JSON.stringify([])) // Used for sending funds if needed
    );
    // Wait for the transaction to be confirmed
    await executeResponse.wait();
    console.log(executeResponse);
    setIsIncrementing(false);
    await fetchCount();
  };
 
  return (
    <>
      <div className="card">
        {contract ? (
          <div>
            <h1>Count is {count}</h1>
            <button disabled={isIncrementing} onClick={incrementCount}>
              {isIncrementing ? "incrementing..." : "increment"}
            </button>
          </div>
        ) : (
          <button onClick={connectWallet}>Connect Wallet</button>
        )}
      </div>
    </>
  );
}
 
export default App;
```

### Detailed outline of `App.tsx`

**State Declarations**

- `count`: Holds the current count fetched from the smart contract.
- `contract`: An instance of the ethers Contract object, used for interacting with the blockchain.
- `isIncrementing`: A boolean to manage UI state during contract execution

**Effect Hooks**

A single `useEffect` hook to fetch the current count whenever the contract state changes, indicating that the contract instance is ready for interaction.

**Connecting to EVM Wallet**

A function named `connectWallet` that:

- Checks for any EVM compatible wallet extension.
- Establishes a connection to the Ethereum network via the connected wallet, using ethers.js BrowserProvider.
- Verifies the correct network (Sei EVM devnet) by comparing chainId.
- Creates an ethers.js Contract instance with the signer from the wallet, setting it in the contract state for later use.

**Fetching Contract Data**

A function named `fetchCount` that:

- Executes a contract query to get the current count.
- Parses and updates the count state with the response.

**Incrementing the Counter**

A function named `incrementCount` that:

- Sends a transaction to the smart contract to increment the count.
- Waits for the transaction to be confirmed.
- Refetches the count to update the UI with the new value.


To see your app in action, run `npm run dev` to spin up a local version of the application. Once you connect your wallet, you should see a counter, as well as a button you can use to increment the counter on the contract.

Congrats on deploying your first interoperable dApp on Sei!

<Tabs.Tab>
In this section, we'll use the [@sei-js](https://github.com/sei-protocol/sei-js/) library to build a React app that interacts with a CosmWasm contract.

## Requirements

Before starting, ensure you have:

- Node.js & NPM installed
- A Sei wallet extension, such as:
  - [Compass](https://compasswallet.io/)
  - [Fin](https://finwallet.com/)

## Creating a React Project

If you're starting a project from scratch, we recommend using the TypeScript template from Vite for easier development and debugging.

```bash copy
npm create vite@latest my-counter-frontend -- --template react-ts
```

This command creates a new folder with a React project using TypeScript. Open `my-counter-frontend` in your favorite IDE.

<Callout type="info">
  The rest of this tutorial will be in TypeScript. If you're not using
  TypeScript, you can easily adjust by removing the types.
</Callout>

## Installing Dependencies

From the terminal at the root of your project, install the required dependencies: `@sei-js/core` and `@sei-js/react`.

```bash copy
npm install @sei-js/core @sei-js/react
```

<Callout type="info">
  `@sei-js` contains NPM libraries for writing applications that interact with
  Sei. Learn more [here](https://github.com/sei-protocol/sei-js/tree/main).
</Callout>

## Wrapping App in SeiWalletProvider

Replace the code in your `App.tsx` file with the following to set up a `SeiWalletProvider` context, define your chain info, and set connection URLs.

```tsx copy
import { SeiWalletProvider } from "@sei-js/react";
import "./App.css";
import Home from "./Home.tsx";

function App() {
  return (
    // Set up SeiWalletProvider for easy wallet connection and to use hooks in @sei-js/react
    <SeiWalletProvider
      chainConfiguration={{
        chainId: "arctic-1",
        restUrl: "https://rest.arctic-1.seinetwork.io",
        rpcUrl: "https://rpc.arctic-1.seinetwork.io",
      }}
      wallets={["compass", "fin"]}
    >
      <Home />
    </SeiWalletProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Detailed outline of `App.tsx`

**Wallet Provider Setup**

- Imports `SeiWalletProvider` from the `@sei-js/react` package.
- Wraps `App` with `SeiWalletProvider` for wallet context.

**Chain Configuration**

- Specifies the `chainConfiguration` prop in `SeiWalletProvider` to set up the blockchain network:
  - `chainId`: Identifies the Sei network (in this case, `arctic-1`).
  - `restUrl`: REST URL for the Sei (You may need your own provider).
  - `rpcUrl`: RPC URL for the Sei (You may need your own provider).

**Supported Wallets**

- Sets up supported wallet types (`'compass'`, `'fin'`, `'leap'`, `'keplr'`) in the wallets prop.

## Adding Home Component

Create a file named `Home.tsx` in your `src` directory with the following code:

```tsx copy
import { useCallback, useEffect, useState } from "react";
import {
  useCosmWasmClient,
  useSigningCosmWasmClient,
  useWallet,
  WalletConnectButton,
} from "@sei-js/react";

// arctic-1 example contract
const CONTRACT_ADDRESS =
  "sei14hj2tavq8fpesdwxxcu44rty3hh90vhujrvcmstl4zr3txmfvw9sh9m79m";

function Home() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState<number | undefined>();
  const [error, setError] = useState<string>("");
  const [isIncrementing, setIsIncrementing] = useState<boolean>(false);

  // Helpful hook for getting the currently connected wallet and chain info
  const { connectedWallet, accounts } = useWallet();

  // For querying cosmwasm smart contracts
  const { cosmWasmClient: queryClient } = useCosmWasmClient();

  // For executing messages on cosmwasm smart contracts
  const { signingCosmWasmClient: signingClient } = useSigningCosmWasmClient();

  const fetchCount = useCallback(async () => {
    const response = await queryClient?.queryContractSmart(CONTRACT_ADDRESS, {
      get_count: {},
    });
    return response?.count;
  }, [queryClient]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchCount().then(setCount);
  }, [connectedWallet, fetchCount]);

  const incrementCounter = async () => {
    setIsIncrementing(true);
    try {
      const senderAddress = accounts[0].address;

      // Build message content
      const msg = { increment: {} };

      // Define gas price and limit
      const fee = {
        amount: [{ amount: "20000", denom: "usei" }],
        gas: "200000",
      };

      // Call smart contract execute msg
      await signingClient?.execute(senderAddress, CONTRACT_ADDRESS, msg, fee);

      // Updates the counter state again
      const updatedCount = await fetchCount();
      setCount(updatedCount);

      setIsIncrementing(false);
      setError("");
    } catch (error) {
      if (error instanceof Error) {
        setError(error.message);
      } else {
        setError("unknown error");
      }
      setIsIncrementing(false);
    }
  };

  // Helpful component for wallet connection
  if (!connectedWallet) return <WalletConnectButton />;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Count is: {count ? count : "---"}</h1>
      <button disabled={isIncrementing} onClick={incrementCounter}>
        {isIncrementing ? "incrementing..." : "increment"}
      </button>
      {error && <p style={{ color: "red" }}>{error}</p>}
    </div>
  );
}

export default Home;
```

We deployed a counter contract on the `arctic-1` testnet. Contract address: `sei14hj2tavq8fpesdwxxcu44rty3hh90vhujrvcmstl4zr3txmfvw9sh9m79m`. Learn more about this contract [here](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-template).

### Detailed outline of `Home.tsx`

**Render Logic**

- Shows `WalletConnectButton` if no wallet is connected.
- Otherwise, displays the counter value and an "Increment" button.
- Disables the button when a transaction is pending.
- Catches and displays error messages, if any.

**Wallet and Client Setup**

- Utilizes `useWallet` hook from `@sei-js/react` to get the connected wallet and accounts.
- Uses `useCosmWasmClient` and `useSigningCosmWasmClient` hooks from `@sei-js/react` to instantiate `queryClient` and `signingClient`. The signing client can be used for querying, but it is not recommended to use a signing client when only a query client is needed.

**Fetching Counter Value**

- `fetchCount` function uses `queryClient.queryContractSmart` to query the smart contract with the query `{ get_count: {} }`.

**Incrementing Counter**

- `incrementCounter` function:
  - Extracts `senderAddress` from the connected wallet's accounts.
  - Builds a message with `{ increment: {} }` to be sent to the smart contract.
  - Specifies the transaction fee with gas price and gas limit.
  - Calls `signingClient.execute` to execute the contract with the built message and fee.

By leveraging `@sei-js` and its hooks, the component provides a way to connect to a wallet, query a CosmWasm smart contract to get the current counter state, and increment it with an execute message.

## Running the App

Run `npm run dev` and navigate to http://localhost:5173/ to view your application.

<Callout type="info">
  If this is your first time using Sei, you might see an error which says your
