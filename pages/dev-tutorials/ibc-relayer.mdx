# IBC Relayer

For IBC protocol overview, refer to

[IBC Protocol](https://www.notion.so/IBC-Protocol-61a7d667b530434c8841dde8f3aa2612?pvs=21)

# Overview

**Relayers** are permissionless off-chain processes that ferry data packets from one chain to another. [Relayer](https://www.ibcprotocol.dev/technical-resource-catalog?category=Relayer#results)s scan chain states, build transactions based on these states, and submit the transactions to the chains involved in the network. Relayers play a crucial role in IBC because chains do not directly send messages to each other over networking infrastructure. Instead, they create and store the data to be retrieved and used by a relayer to build IBC packets.

There are several relayer implementations in different languages:

- Golang [relayer](https://github.com/cosmos/relayer)
- Rust [hermes](https://hermes.informal.systems/)

# Running relayer with Sei

## Installation

We will be using hermes as example relayer. Please note, that Sei requires hermes of version `1.3.0` .

To install hermes simply head to the GitHub [Releases](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/releases) page and download Hermes binary matching your platform:

- macOS: `hermes-v1.3.0-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz` (or .zip),
- Linux: `hermes-v1.3.0-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz` (or .zip).

The step-by-step instruction below should carry you through the whole process:

1. Make the directory where we'll place the binary:

 ```

 mkdir -p $HOME/.hermes/bin

    ```

2. Extract the binary archive:

 ```

 tar -C $HOME/.hermes/bin/ -vxzf $ARCHIVE_NAME

    ```

3. Update your path, by adding this line in your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` shell configuration file:

 ```

 export PATH="$HOME/.hermes/bin:$PATH"
    ```


The `Source code` [archive](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/archive/refs/tags/v1.3.0.tar.gz) also contains hermes documentation that you can follow in `guide/book` folder.

## Configuration

`$HOME/.hermes/config.toml` file should look like below. Please note that this example assumes local chains, so all RPC urls have to be substituted for real chain ones.

```toml
[global]
log_level = 'info'

[mode]

[mode.clients]
enabled = true
refresh = true
misbehaviour = true

[mode.connections]
enabled = true

[mode.channels]
enabled = true

[mode.packets]
enabled = true
clear_interval = 100
clear_on_start = true
tx_confirmation = true

[telemetry]
enabled = true
host = '127.0.0.1'
port = 3001

[[chains]]
id = 'ibc-0'
rpc_addr = 'http://localhost:27030'
grpc_addr = 'http://localhost:27032'
websocket_addr = 'ws://localhost:27030/websocket'
rpc_timeout = '15s'
account_prefix = 'cosmos'
key_name = 'wallet'
store_prefix = 'ibc'
gas_price = { price = 0.01, denom = 'stake' }
max_gas = 10000000
gas_multiplier = 1.5
clock_drift = '5s'
trusting_period = '14days'
trust_threshold = { numerator = '1', denominator = '3' }

[[chains]]
id = 'sei-chain'
rpc_addr = 'http://localhost:26657'
grpc_addr = 'http://localhost:9090'
websocket_addr = 'ws://localhost:26657/websocket'
rpc_timeout = '15s'
account_prefix = 'sei'
key_name = 'wallet'
store_prefix = 'ibc'
gas_price = { price = 0.025, denom = 'usei' }
max_gas = 10000000
gas_multiplier = 2
clock_drift = '5s'
trusting_period = '14days'
trust_threshold = { numerator = '1', denominator = '3' }

```

Next we need to add the account keys to hermes.

```bash

$ hermes keys add --key-name wallet --chain sei-chain --mnemonic-file ~/misc/mm_file_sei
$ hermes keys add --key-name wallet --chain ibc-0 --mnemonic-file ~/misc/mm_file_ibc_0

```

The contents of ~/misc/mm_file_* file is just a seed phrase of the chain account that will be associated with the chain.

Finally we need to create clients, connections and channel. There are separate commands for that, but there is a simpler shortcut command:

```bash
$ hermes create channel --a-chain sei-chain --b-chain ibc-0 --a-port transfer --b-port transfer --new-client-connection
```

The output of this command should return created channel details.

Finally start relaying:

```bash
$ hermes start
```

Please note, that this tutorial is a simplified version. Running relayer in production would require different level of
 effort, configuration and monitoring.

For more information on hermes, please refer to the [official 1.3 version documentation](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes/archive/refs/tags/v1.3.0.tar.gz)
that can be found in the `guide/book` folder of the source code archive.
