# Overview

The Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol is a blockchain interoperability solution that allows blockchains to transfer any type of data encoded in bytes, in a secure and permissionless manner.

The most popular IBC use case arguably is token swaps between different blockchains.

## What differentiates IBC from other bridging protocols?

**Universal Interoperability**. Chains that speak IBC can share any type of data as long as it's encoded in bytes, enabling the industry’s most feature-rich cross-chain interactions.

**Permissionless access**. IBC is completely open-source: Anyone can build with IBC, and there’s no in-protocol rent extraction or hidden fees.

**Security**. IBC’s light client-based interoperability removes the need for a trusted third party in cross-chain interactions, securing tens of billions in annual value transfer without a single exploit since launch.

# Design Principles

The design principles of IBC drew inspiration from the TCP/IP specification that enabled the creation of the internet. Mirroring the way TCP/IP sets the standard for seamless communication between computers, IBC defines a universal framework of abstractions that lets blockchains communicate.

The IBC protocol stack can be decoupled into two distinct elements: the **[IBC Transport Layer](https://www.ibcprotocol.dev/blog/what-are-the-ibc-transport-and-application-layers)** and the **[IBC Application Layer](https://www.ibcprotocol.dev/blog/what-are-the-ibc-transport-and-application-layers).**

The **IBC Transport Layer** is agnostic to the contents of transferred data packets, much like TCP/IP. The IBC Transport Layer is a foundational layer upon which feature-rich applications are developed, similar to the applications that sit on top of TCP/IP and allow for the flourishing of end-user Internet applications.

The transport layer handles data packet transport, authentication, and ordering. The key components of the transport layer are light clients, connections, channels, and relayers.

**Light clients** are the heart of the IBC Transport Layer. A [light client](https://www.ibcprotocol.dev/technical-resource-catalog?category=Light+Client#results) is a lightweight representation of destination chain that live within the state machine of the source chain.

For example, chains A and B are connected over IBC via their light clients. Chain A will have a light client representing chain B in its own state machine, and Chain B has a light client of Chain A. Light clients keep track of a counterparty blockchain’s consensus algorithm by verifying block headers and Merkle proofs.

**Connections** are responsible for connecting two different light clients together.

**Channels** act as a conduit to connect a module/application on the source chain to a module on the destination chain. Data packets between the source and destination chains are sent over this abstraction layer.

**Relayers** are permissionless off-chain processes that ferry data packets from one chain to another. [Relayer](https://www.ibcprotocol.dev/technical-resource-catalog?category=Relayer#results)s scan chain states, build transactions based on these states, and submit the transactions to the chains involved in the network. Relayers play a crucial role in IBC because chains do not directly send messages to each other over networking infrastructure. Instead, they create and store the data to be retrieved and used by a relayer to build IBC packets.

# Asset transfer

## Command line

In order to transfer funds from Sei to other chain or other way round we need several bits of information. In particular:

- from wallet e.g. Sei bech32 address
- to wallet e.g. Axelar bech32 address
- the source channel and port id
  - These could be located in [registry](https://github.com/sei-protocol/chain-registry/blob/main/ibc_info.json). E.g. for `atlantic-2` Axelar, we would use:

  ```json
      {
        "counterparty_chain_name": "axelar-testnet-lisbon-3",
        "dst_channel": "channel-257",
        "src_channel": "channel-44",
        "port_id": "transfer",
        "client_id": "07-tendermint-80"
      },
    ```


With that information on hand we could run a cmd command to perform transfer like:

```bash
$ seid tx ibc-transfer transfer transfer channel-44 $AXELAR_ADDRESS 200sei --from $SEI_ADDRESS --fees 4000usei  --node https://rpc-testnet.sei-apis.com --chain-id atlantic-2 -b block
```

This would transfer 200 sei from sei address to axelar address.

## JS Client

```tsx
import {ethers} from "ethers";
import {IBC_PRECOMPILE_ADDRESS, IBC_PRECOMPILE_ABI} from "@sei-js/evm";

const transferWithDefaultTimeout = async () => {
      const signer = await getEthSigner();

      if(!signer) {
          toast.error('No signer found');
          return;
      }
      const contract = new ethers.Contract(IBC_PRECOMPILE_ADDRESS, IBC_PRECOMPILE_ABI, signer);
      const axelarAddress = AXELAR_ADDRESS

      try {
          console.log("Transfer")
          const result = await contract.transferWithDefaultTimeout(axelarAddress, "transfer", "channel-44", "usei", "76000", "memo text");
          console.log("TransferResult: ", result);
      }
      catch (e) {
          console.log(e)
      }

  };
```
