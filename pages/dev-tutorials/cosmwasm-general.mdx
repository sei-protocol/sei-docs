# CosmWasm (general)

CosmWasm is a smart contract platform focusing on security, performance, and interoperability It is the only smart contracting platform for public blockchains with heavy adoption outside of the EVM world.

Key features of CosmWasm are:

**Secure**

CosmWasm architecture prevents almost all the known risk vectors of Ethereum.

**Powerful**

CosmWasm runs the Web Assembly, Wasm virtual machine guarantees high performance.

**Interoprable**

CosmWasm was built for multi-chain, cross-chain world, deeply integrated with IBC (Inter-blockchain communication).

# Smart contract language

CosmWasm smart contracts are written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language. Here’s a good reference if you would like to make a [deep dive](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

## Rust

Why Rust?

**Performance.** Rust is blazingly fast and memory-efficient: with no runtime or garbage collector, it can power performance-critical services, run on embedded devices, and easily integrate with other languages.

**Reliability.** Rust’s rich type system and ownership model guarantee memory-safety and thread-safety — enabling you to eliminate many classes of bugs at compile-time.

**Productivity.** Rust has great documentation, a friendly compiler with useful error messages, and top-notch tooling — an integrated package manager and build tool, smart multi-editor support with auto-completion and type inspections, an auto-formatter, and more.

### Example CosmWasm smart contract

```rust
// cosmwasm_std is a standard library for smart contracts.
// It provides essential utilities for communication with the outside world
// and a couple of helper functions and types.
// Every smart contract uses this dependency.
use cosmwasm_std::{
    entry_point, to_binary, Binary, Deps, DepsMut, Empty, Env, MessageInfo,
    Response, StdResult,
};
// serde is a serialization/deserilization library
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

// Query response data structure
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct QueryResp {
    message: String,
}

// Typical Rust application starts with the fn main() function called by
// the operating system. Smart contracts are not significantly different.
// When the message is sent to the contract, a function called "entry point"
// is called. Unlike native applications, which have only a single main entry
// point, smart contracts have a couple corresponding to different message types:
// instantiate, execute, query, sudo, migrate and more
#[entry_point]
// instantiate is called once per smart contract lifetime - you can think about
// it as a constructor or initializer of a contract.
pub fn instantiate(
    // DepsMut is a utility type for communicating with the outer world -
    // it allows querying and updating the contract state,
    // querying other contracts state, and gives access to an Api object with
    // a couple of helper functions for dealing with CW addresses.
    _deps: DepsMut,
    // Env is an object representing the blockchains state when executing
    // the message - the chain height and id, current timestamp, and the called
    // contract address.
    _env: Env,
    // MessageInfo contains metainformation about the message which triggered
    // an execution - an address that sends the message, and chain native
    // tokens sent with the message.
    _info: MessageInfo,
    // Empty is the message triggering execution itself, it is Empty type
    // that represents {} JSON, but the type of this argument can be anything
    // that is deserializable.
    _msg: Empty,
) -> StdResult<Response> {
    Ok(Response::new())
}

// Another entry point
#[entry_point]
pub fn query(
    // Deps object is readonly as opposed to DevMut above.
    // That is because the query can never alter the smart contract's internal
    // state. It can only read the state. It comes with some consequences -
    // for example, it is impossible to implement caching for future queries
    // (as it would require some data cache to write to).
    _deps: Deps,
    _env: Env,
    _msg: Empty
 ) -> StdResult<Binary> {
    let resp = QueryResp {
        message: "Hello World".to_owned(),
    };

    to_binary(&resp)
}
```

# Deploying a smart contract on Sei

Let’s create a simple smart contract project from template.

Assuming you have a recent version of Rust and Cargo installed (via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)), then the following should get you a new repo to start a contract:

Install [cargo-generate](https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/cargo-generate) and cargo-run-script. 

```bash
cargo install cargo-generate --features vendored-openssl
cargo install cargo-run-script
```

Now, let’s use it to create your new contract project. Go to the folder in which you want to place it and run:

```bash
cargo generate --git https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-template.git --name counter
```

Choose `false` when asked `Would you like to generate the minimal template?` .

This should create a `counter` contract project with source code generated inside folder with the same name.

Once inside the project open `Cargo.toml` and remove features we won’t need.

```bash
cosmwasm-std = { version = "2.0.1", features = [
  "cosmwasm_1_3",
  # Enable this if you only deploy to chains that have CosmWasm 1.4 or higher
  # "cosmwasm_1_4",
] }
```

modify this line to

```bash
cosmwasm-std =  "2.0.0"
```

Before proceeding further let’s test the contract to make sure code is intact. Run

```bash
cargo test
```

You should see output similar to

```bash
 Finished test [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.09s
     Running unittests src/lib.rs (target/debug/deps/c3-777d376b6d32a663)

running 4 tests
test contract::tests::proper_initialization ... ok
test contract::tests::increment ... ok
test contract::tests::reset ... ok
test integration_tests::tests::count::count ... ok

test result: ok. 4 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s

     Running unittests src/bin/schema.rs (target/debug/deps/schema-283e665754e86143)

running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s

   Doc-tests c3

running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s

```

Now, important steps involved in the contract deployment are building and optimization. Optimization is important to make sure contract will take least amount of space on blockchain possible and will require less gas. [Optimizer](https://github.com/CosmWasm/optimizer) project has been created specifically for that purpose.

Our generated project contains already an alias command that we could run to invoke building and optimization:

```toml
# Catgo.toml

[package.metadata.scripts]
optimize = """docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/code \
  --mount type=volume,source="$(basename "$(pwd)")_cache",target=/target \
  --mount type=volume,source=registry_cache,target=/usr/local/cargo/registry \
  cosmwasm/optimizer:0.15.0
"""
```

So we just run:

```bash
$ cargo run-script optimize
```

After command runs successfully, we could fund our wasm artifact in `artifact` directory.

We could also verify it by running a `cosmwasm-check` command:

```bash
$ cosmwasm-check artifacts/counter.wasm

Available capabilities: {"stargate", "cosmwasm_1_1", "cosmwasm_1_3", "cosmwasm_2_0", "cosmwasm_1_4", "iterator", "cosmwasm_1_2", "staking"}

artifacts/counter.wasm: pass

All contracts (1) passed checks!

```

Now we are ready to deploy our contract.

Let’s deploy our contract to Sei test network `atlantic-2` . Should you choose another Sei network, it can be found in our registry [here](https://github.com/sei-protocol/chain-registry/blob/main/chains.json).

```bash
$ seid tx wasm store artifacts/counter.wasm --from $SEI_WALLET_ADDRESS  --node https://rpc-testnet.sei-apis.com --chain-id atlantic-2 -b block --fees=200000usei --gas=2000000
```

Note the code in events:

```bash
- events:
  - attributes:
    - key: action
      value: /cosmwasm.wasm.v1.MsgStoreCode
    - key: module
      value: wasm
    - key: sender
      value:
    type: message
  - attributes:
    - key: code_id
      value: "8363" <--- Code ID
    type: store_code
  log: ""
  msg_index: 0

```

Now lets, instantiate the contract:

```bash
$ seid tx wasm instantiate 8363 '{"count":1}' -y --no-admin --label counter --from $SEI_WALLET_ADDRESS --node https://rpc-testnet.sei-apis.com --chain-id atlantic-2 -b block --fees=40000usei --gas=2000000
```

Note the contract address in the output.

Query the contract:

```bash
$ seid q wasm contract-state smart $CONTRACT_ADDRESS '{"get_count": {}}'  --node https://rpc-testnet.sei-apis.com
```

Response should look like:

```bash
data:
  count: 1
```

Now lets call `increment` function:

```bash
$ seid tx wasm execute $CONTRACT_ADDRESS '{"increment": {}}'  --from $SEI_WALLET_ADDRESS  --node https://rpc-testnet.sei-apis.com --chain-id atlantic-2 -b block --fees=4000usei
```

If successful, we can now re-query contract state and see counter incremented:

```bash
data:
  count: 2
```

## Calling contract from JS client

To call the contract from frontend in EVM environment you could use `ethers` and  `@sei-js` library:

```tsx
import {WASM_PRECOMPILE_ABI, WASM_PRECOMPILE_ADDRESS} from "@sei-js/evm";

const signer = await getEthSigner();

if (!signer) {
    console.log('No signer found');
    return;
}
const contract = new ethers.Contract(WASM_PRECOMPILE_ADDRESS, WASM_PRECOMPILE_ABI, signer);

const counterContractAddress = CONTRACT_ADDRESS;

const queryJSON = {get_count: {}}
try {
    const response = await contract.query(counterContractAddress, toUtf8Bytes(JSON.stringify(queryJSON)));
    console.log(toUtf8String(response));
} catch (e) {
    console.log(e);
}
```
