# Social logins with Particle Connect

[Particle Network](https://particle.network) simplifies onboarding into both EOAs and ERC-4337 smart accounts using its Wallet Abstraction stack. Specifically, Particle enables an aggregated modal featuring both social logins and wallet adapters (such as MetaMask) fully compatible with Sei, enabling 2-click onboarding.

The Particle Connect user flow begins with social login, either through custom authentication or predefined options offered by the platform (like email, Google, X). This process generates an EOA using MPC-TSS, which then can act as the Signer for a smart account. This can include implementations like `SimpleAccount` or Biconomy (V1/V2), depending on the application's requirements.

This guide provides a high-level overview of the steps required to build a demo application on Sei using the [Particle Connect SDK](https://developers.particle.network/api-reference/connect/desktop/web), Particle's leading onboarding solution. We'll implement the aforementioned modal, enabling social logins and wallet connection, while also using account abstraction to send a gasless transaction.

Thus, the demo application we'll build will:

1. Use a **SimpleAccount** instance of a smart account to onboard users via social login.
2. Execute a **gasless (sponsored) transaction**, showcasing the SDK's capability to simplify user interactions on the Sei blockchain.

## Getting started

### Dependencies

To integrate Particle Connect into your Sei application, you'll need just a few dependencies. While Particle Connect includes built-in support for Account Abstraction (AA), this example demonstrates using the Particle AA SDK alongside an EIP-1193 provider, such as ethers.js.

```bash
yarn add @particle-network/connectkit viem@^2 @particle-network/aa ethers
```

### Setting up the Particle dashboard

Before jumping into the configuration process, you'll need to go to the [Particle dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network) to retrieve three keys required for your project.

When using any SDK offered by Particle Network, you'll routinely need a `projectId`, `clientKey`, and `appId`. These exist to authenticate your project and create a connection between your instance of Particle Auth and the Particle dashboard (which allows you to customize the application-embedded modals, track users, fund gasless transactions, and so on).

Once you've navigated to the Particle dashboard, follow the process below:

1. Create a new project through **Add New Project**.
2. Click **Web** under **Your Apps** (if you intend to use an alternative platform, take a look at the [platform-specific guides on Particle's documentation](https://developers.particle.network/reference/introduction-to-api-sdk-reference))
3. Choose a name and domain for your application (if you have yet to deploy or decide on a domain where you intend to deploy, feel free to use any filler one).
4. Copy the **Project ID**, **Client Key** and **App ID**.

Given the nature of these values, it's recommended that you store them within a `.env` file with this format:

```shell
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID='PROJECT_ID'
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_KEY='CLIENT_KEY'
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ID='APP_ID'
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID='WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID'
```

## Configuring Particle Connect

To get started, we'll configure and initialize Particle Connect. Begin by creating a new `ConnectKit.tsx` file in your `src` directory.

This file will define the `ParticleConnectKit` component, which wraps the configured `ConnectKitProvider` instance. This component will be the central hub for managing and providing Particle Connect configuration across your application.

```typescript
"use client";

import React from "react";
import { ConnectKitProvider, createConfig } from "@particle-network/connectkit";
import { authWalletConnectors } from "@particle-network/connectkit/auth";
import { evmWalletConnectors } from "@particle-network/connectkit/evm";
import { sei, seiTestnet } from "@particle-network/connectkit/chains";
import { wallet, EntryPosition } from "@particle-network/connectkit/wallet";
import { aa } from "@particle-network/connectkit/aa";

const config = createConfig({
  projectId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID!,
  clientKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_KEY!,
  appId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ID!,

  walletConnectors: [
    authWalletConnectors({}), // Social logins

    // Default Web3 logins
    evmWalletConnectors({
      walletConnectProjectId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID, // optional, retrieved from https://cloud.walletconnect.com
    }),
  ],

  plugins: [
    wallet({
      entryPosition: EntryPosition.BR, // Positions the modal button at the bottom right on login
      visible: true, // Determines if the wallet modal is displayed
    }),
    aa({
      name: "SIMPLE",
      version: "2.0.0",
    }),
  ],
  chains: [sei, seiTestnet],
});

export const ParticleConnectkit = ({ children }: React.PropsWithChildren) => {
  return <ConnectKitProvider config={config}>{children}</ConnectKitProvider>;
};
```

This code sets up Particle Connect with a configuration for wallet authentication and blockchain interactions on Sei and Sei testnet. It includes social logins and traditional Web3 options through WalletConnect and enables Account Abstraction (AA) with a `SimpleAccount` instance version 2.0.0. The configured `ConnectKitProvider` component then wraps the app’s content, making this configuration available.

## Integrate Particle Connect in Your App

Once configured, wrap your application with the `ParticleConnectKit` component to make the Particle Connect SDK accessible throughout the app. Update the `layout.tsx` file in the `src` directory as shown below:

```tsx
import { ParticleConnectkit } from '@/components/Connectkit';
import type { Metadata } from 'next';
import { Inter } from 'next/font/google';
import './globals.css';

const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] });

export const metadata: Metadata = {
	title: 'Particle Connectkit App',
	description: 'Generated by create next app'
};

export default function RootLayout({
	children
}: Readonly<{
	children: React.ReactNode;
}>) {
	return (
		<html lang='en'>
			<body className={inter.className}>
				<ParticleConnectkit>{children}</ParticleConnectkit>
			</body>
		</html>
	);
}
```

## Building the Application

With your project set up, dependencies installed, and Particle Connect configured, you can start building in the `page.tsx` file.

In `page.tsx`, you’ll define the core features: login flow, transaction handling, and the UI.

### Connecting the Wallet

With `layout.tsx` configured, the next step is to add a primary **Connect Wallet** button to facilitate user login. Import `ConnectButton` from `@particle-network/connectkit` and add it to the interface. After the user logs in, the `ConnectButton` component will throw a unified login modal upon clicking, an example of this modal is viewable [here](https://demo.particle.network).

```tsx
'use client';
import { ConnectButton, useAccount } from '@particle-network/connectkit';

const HomePage = () => {
	const { address, isConnected, chainId } = useAccount();

	return (
		<div className='flex justify-center items-center h-screen'>
			<div className='text-center'>
				<ConnectButton />
				{isConnected && (
					<>
						<h2>Address: {address}</h2>
						<h2>Chain ID: {chainId}</h2>
					</>
				)}
			</div>
		</div>
	);
};

export default HomePage;
```

### Sending Transactions with an EIP-1193 Provider

Particle Connect includes AA features out of the box, but using it with the Particle AA SDK allows you to work with EIP-1193 providers, like `ethers`. This approach is especially helpful if you're already familiar with these providers or are integrating Particle Connect into an existing app.

To implement this, wrap the smart account provided by Particle Connect in an instance of `ethers` to create a `customProvider`. With this setup, you can use `ethers` as usual, with the smart account handling the signing of transactions in the background.

```tsx
import { useSmartAccount } from '@particle-network/connectkit';
import { AAWrapProvider, SendTransactionMode } from '@particle-network/aa';

const smartAccount = useSmartAccount();

// Init custom provider with gasless transaction mode
const customProvider = smartAccount ? new ethers.BrowserProvider(new AAWrapProvider(smartAccount, SendTransactionMode.Gasless) as Eip1193Provider, 'any') : null;

/**
 * Sends a transaction using the ethers.js library.
 * This transaction is gasless since the customProvider is initialized as gasless
 */
const executeTxEthers = async () => {
	if (!customProvider) return;

	const signer = await customProvider.getSigner();
	const tx = {
		to: recipientAddress,
		value: parseEther('0.01').toString()
	};

	const txResponse = await signer.sendTransaction(tx);
	const txReceipt = await txResponse.wait();
	console.log(txReceipt?.hash);
};
```

This transaction will be gasless because it meets two key conditions:

1. **Gasless Mode Configuration**: By setting `SendTransactionMode.Gasless` within `AAWrapProvider`, we've specified that the transaction should be gasless and sponsored.
2. **Funding Requirements**: On a Testnet like Sei, all transactions are automatically sponsored, meaning you don't need to deposit USDT to cover transaction fees. However, on mainnets like Sei, the Paymaster (configurable in the [Particle dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network)) would need sufficient funds to sponsor these transactions.

This example demonstrates how to use an existing EIP-1193 provider, but you can also construct a `userOp` directly with Particle Connect. For an example, refer to the [starter repository](https://github.com/Particle-Network/connectkit-aa-usage/blob/2017262daf297624362d51f3d50cccd3b4606ef9/app/page.tsx#L117).

## Full app example

With the setup complete, Particle Connect can now be leveraged, as demonstrated in the example application below.

In this example, the application creates a smart account on Sei using a social login or a Web3 login and sends a gasless transaction of 0.01 SEI via the `ethers` provider.

```tsx
'use client';
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

// Particle imports
import { ConnectButton, useAccount, usePublicClient, useSmartAccount } from '@particle-network/connectkit';

// Eip1193 and AA Provider
import { AAWrapProvider, SendTransactionMode } from '@particle-network/aa'; // Only needed with Eip1193 provider
import { ethers, type Eip1193Provider } from 'ethers';
import { formatEther, parseEther } from 'viem';

export default function Home() {
	const { isConnected, chain } = useAccount();
	const publicClient = usePublicClient();
	const smartAccount = useSmartAccount();

	const [userAddress, setUserAddress] = useState<string>('');
	const [balance, setBalance] = useState<string | null>(null);
	const [recipientAddress, setRecipientAddress] = useState<string>('');
	const [transactionHash, setTransactionHash] = useState<string | null>(null);

	// Init custom provider with gasless transaction mode
	const customProvider = smartAccount ? new ethers.BrowserProvider(new AAWrapProvider(smartAccount, SendTransactionMode.Gasless) as Eip1193Provider, 'any') : null;

	/**
	 * Fetches the balance of a given address.
	 * @param {string} address - The address to fetch the balance for.
	 */
	const fetchBalance = async (address: string) => {
		try {
			const balanceResponse = await publicClient?.getBalance({
				address: address as `0x${string}`
			});
			if (balanceResponse) {
				const balanceInEther = formatEther(balanceResponse).toString();
				setBalance(balanceInEther);
			} else {
				setBalance('0.0');
			}
		} catch (error) {
			console.error('Error fetching balance:', error);
			setBalance('0.0');
		}
	};

	/**
	 * Loads the user's account data, including address and balance.
	 */
	useEffect(() => {
		const loadAccountData = async () => {
			if (isConnected && smartAccount) {
				try {
					const address = await smartAccount.getAddress();
					setUserAddress(address);
					await fetchBalance(address);
				} catch (error) {
					console.error('Error loading account data:', error);
				}
			}
		};
		loadAccountData();
	}, [isConnected, smartAccount]);

	/**
	 * Sends a transaction using the ethers.js library.
	 * This transaction is gasless since the customProvider is initialized as gasless
	 */
	const executeTxEthers = async () => {
		if (!customProvider) return;

		const signer = await customProvider.getSigner();
		try {
			const tx = {
				to: recipientAddress,
				value: parseEther('0.001').toString()
			};

			const txResponse = await signer.sendTransaction(tx);
			const txReceipt = await txResponse.wait();

			setTransactionHash(txReceipt?.hash || null);
		} catch (error) {
			console.error('Failed to send transaction using ethers.js:', error);
		}
	};

	return (
		<div className='container min-h-screen flex flex-col justify-center items-center mx-auto gap-4 px-4 md:px-8'>
			<div className='w-full flex justify-center mt-4'>
				<ConnectButton label='Click to login' />
			</div>
			{isConnected && (
				<>
					<div className='border border-purple-500 p-6 rounded-lg w-full'>
						<h2 className='text-lg font-semibold mb-2 text-white'>
							Address: <code>{userAddress || 'Loading...'}</code>
						</h2>
						<h2 className='text-lg font-semibold mb-2 text-white'>
							Balance: {balance || 'Loading...'} {chain?.nativeCurrency.symbol}
						</h2>
						<input
							type='text'
							placeholder='Recipient Address'
							value={recipientAddress}
							onChange={(e) => setRecipientAddress(e.target.value)}
							className='mt-4 p-3 w-full rounded border border-gray-700 bg-gray-900 text-white focus:outline-none'
						/>
						<button
							className='bg-purple-600 hover:bg-purple-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded mt-4'
							onClick={executeTxEthers}
							disabled={!recipientAddress}>
							Send 0.001 {chain?.nativeCurrency.name}
						</button>
						{transactionHash && <p className='text-green-500 mt-4'>Transaction Hash: {transactionHash}</p>}
					</div>
				</>
			)}
		</div>
	);
}
```
