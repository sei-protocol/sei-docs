# Multi-Sig accounts

Multi-signature (multi-sig) accounts provide an enhanced security mechanism by requiring multiple approvals (signatures) for transactions. This guide will walk you through setting up a multi-sig account, signing and broadcasting transactions using seid.

## Creating a multi-sig account

**1. Adding Accounts to Your Local Keychain**

First, add two accounts to your local keychain:

```
seid keys add ms1
seid keys add ms2
```

These commands create two key pairs named ms1 and ms2.

**2. Creating a Multi-Sig Account**

Next, create a multi-sig account that requires signatures from both ms1 and ms2:

```
seid keys add ms1ms2 --multisig-threshold=2 --multisig=ms1,ms2
```

This command sets up a multi-sig account named ms1ms2 with a threshold of 2, meaning it requires signatures from both ms1 and ms2 to authorize transactions.

## **Signing and Broadcasting a Transaction**

Here are the steps to sign and broadcast a transaction from a multi-sig account.

**1. Define an Unsigned Transaction**

Create an unsigned-tx.json file with your unsigned transaction. Below is an example of a JSON structure for sending tokens using a bank send message:

```
{
    "body": {
        "messages": [
            {
                "@type": "/cosmos.bank.v1beta1.MsgSend",
                "from_address": "MULTI_SIG_ACCOUNT",
                "to_address": "DESIRED_DESTINATION_ADDRESS",
                "amount": [
                    {
                        "denom": "usei",
                        "amount": "10"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ],
        "memo": "",
        "timeout_height": "0",
        "extension_options": [],
        "non_critical_extension_options": []
    },
    "auth_info": {
        "signer_infos": [],
        "fee": {
            "amount": [
                {
                    "denom": "usei",
                    "amount": "100000"
                }
            ],
            "gas_limit": "200000",
            "payer": "",
            "granter": ""
        }
    },
    "signatures": []
}
```

Replace MULTI_SIG_ACCOUNT with your multi-sig account address and DESIRED_DESTINATION_ADDRESS with the recipientâ€™s address.

**2. Sign the Unsigned Transaction**

Sign the unsigned transaction from both ms1 and ms2:

```
seid tx sign unsigned-tx.json --multisig=multisigAccountName --from=ms1 --output-document=signer1_signedTx.json --node YOUR_RPC_URL

seid tx sign unsigned-tx.json --multisig=multisigAccountName --from=ms2 --output-document=signer2_signedTx.json --node YOUR_RPC_URL
```

These commands create signer1_signedTx.json and signer2_signedTx.json, which contain the signatures from ms1 and ms2, respectively.

**3. Combine Signatures**

Combine the signatures into a single transaction file:

```
seid tx multisign unsigned-tx.json ms1ms2 signer1_signedTx.json signer2_signedTx.json > signedTx.json
```

This command merges the individual signatures into a single transaction file named signedTx.json.

**4. Broadcast the Multi-Sig Transaction**

Finally, broadcast the signed multi-sig transaction to the network:

```
seid tx broadcast signedTx.json
```

This command sends the combined, signed transaction to the Sei blockchain for processing.

**Summary**

By following these steps, you can set up and use multi-sig accounts on the Sei blockchain. This process enhances security by requiring multiple signatures for transaction approval, reducing the risk of unauthorized transactions. Multi-sig accounts are particularly useful for managing shared assets and ensuring that multiple parties must agree before any significant action is taken.
