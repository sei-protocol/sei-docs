# Governance Precompile

**Address**: `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001006`

This precompile enables participation in Sei's governance process through the EVM, allowing EVM users and contracts to submit proposals, vote, and query governance information.

## Functions

    /// Cast a vote on the specified proposal.
    /// @param proposalId The ID of the proposal to vote on.
    /// @param option The option to vote for. (Refer to the governance module for allowed options)
    /// @return Whether the vote was successfully cast.
    function vote(
        uint64 proposalID,
        int32 option
    ) external returns (bool success);
  ```
