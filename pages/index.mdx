# Welcome to Sei Network

Sei sets a bold new standard in blockchain as the first parallelized 
EVM and delivers unmatched scalability with a developer-focused approach. 

<ImageWithCaption img={v2BannerImg} alt="Sei V2 Banner" />

Sei achieves high performance and low fees through its architecture built 
on a delegated proof-of-stake model and parallel execution for both EVM and 
CosmWasm.

The implementation of twin-turbo consensus and SeiDB sets new standards by 
achieving block times of 400 milliseconds and a transaction throughput designed 
to handle demanding blockchain activity. These advancements establish Sei as a 
pivotal step in the evolution of cross-disciplinary distributed computing 
environments. Sei's approach redefines how distributed architectures operate and 
unlocks new opportunities for innovation and real-world application in 
decentralized ecosystems by advancing the EVM.

What differentiates Sei is its seamless, built-in interoperability. EVM developers are provided with native access to the Cosmos ecosystem, which includes features such as IBC tokens, multi-sig accounts and fee grants. Mechanisms such as Pointer Contracts and Precompile Contracts facilitate smooth interaction between EVM and CosmWasm VMs. These advanced solutions enable developers to work with various asset types including ERC20 to CW20 tokens and CW721 to ERC721 NFTs without sacrificing performance. The integration of vital blockchain modules like IBC and Wasm directly into the EVM through Precompile Contracts enhances this capability. The combination of parallel execution, high throughput and seamless cross-VM operability establishes Sei as a benchmark for blockchain scalability and interconnected ecosystems.
