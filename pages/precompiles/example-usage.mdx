# Example Usage

These precompiles can be used like any standard smart contract on the EVM. For example, using [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/), you can query and execute actions on a CosmWasm contract as follows:

## Setup

To install `ethers`, run the following command in your project directory terminal:

```bash copy
npm install ethers
```

Next, you'll need to use one of the precompiles listed above. In this example, we're going to be using the Wasm precompile:

```typescript copy
// Wasm precompile address
const WASM_PRECOMPILE_ADDRESS = "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001002";

// The precompiled contract ABI (fragments we care about)
// View the entire ABI here: https://github.com/sei-protocol/sei-chain/tree/evm/precompiles/wasmd
const WASM_PRECOMPILE_ABI = [
  {
    inputs: [
      {
        internalType: "string",
        name: "contractAddress",
        type: "string",
      },
      {
        internalType: "bytes",
        name: "msg",
        type: "bytes",
      },
      {
        internalType: "bytes",
        name: "coins",
        type: "bytes",
      },
    ],
    name: "execute",
    outputs: [
      {
        internalType: "bytes",
        name: "response",
        type: "bytes",
      },
    ],
    stateMutability: "nonpayable",
    type: "function",
  },
  {
    inputs: [
      {
        internalType: "string",
        name: "contractAddress",
        type: "string",
      },
      {
        internalType: "bytes",
        name: "req",
        type: "bytes",
      },
    ],
    name: "query",
    outputs: [
      {
        internalType: "bytes",
        name: "response",
        type: "bytes",
      },
    ],
    stateMutability: "view",
    type: "function",
  },
];
```

## Using the contract

Next, we'll set up a provider and contract to interact with the blockchain:

```typescript copy
import { ethers, toUtf8Bytes, toUtf8String } from "ethers";

// Using MetaMask as the signer and provider
const provider = new ethers.BrowserProvider(window.ethereum);
const signer = await provider.getSigner();

// Create a contract with the signer
const contract = new ethers.Contract(
  WASM_PRECOMPILE_ADDRESS,
  WASM_PRECOMPILE_ABI,
  signer
);
```

<Callout type="info">
  If using MetaMask, the wallet must be switched to the Sei EVM Devnet chain.

</Callout>

#### Querying & Executing a CosmWasm Contraact

Once you have the contract, you can query and execute messages to any CosmWasm smart contract.

```typescript
// Counter CosmWasm contract (used for testing on arctic-1)
// Replace with your contract as needed
const COUNTER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS =
  "sei14hj2tavq8fpesdwxxcu44rty3hh90vhujrvcmstl4zr3txmfvw9sh9m79m";

// Query to get the count on the counter contract
const queryMsg = { get_count: {} };
const queryResponse = await contract.query(
  COUNTER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
  toUtf8Bytes(JSON.stringify(queryMsg))
);
console.log(toUtf8String(queryResponse));

// Execute message to increment the count on the contract
const executeMsg = { increment: {} };
const executeResponse = await contract.execute(
  COUNTER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
  toUtf8Bytes(JSON.stringify(executeMsg)),
  toUtf8Bytes(JSON.stringify([])) // Used for sending funds if needed
);
// Wait for the transaction to be confirmed
await executeResponse.wait();
console.log(executeResponse);
```
