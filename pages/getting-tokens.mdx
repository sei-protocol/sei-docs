There are a few ways to acquire tokens on the Sei Mainnet:

## Centralized Exchanges

Purchasing SEI through centralized exchanges is the easiest method. $SEI is available on several major exchanges including:
- [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en-CA/how-to-buy/sei)
- [BitGet](https://www.bitget.com/web3/academy/experience-sei)
- [KuCoin](https://www.kucoin.com/how-to-buy/sei)

## Bridging

Bridging is essential for transferring tokens between different blockchains. This allows you to utilize tokens from various chains on the Sei network in their wrapped forms. It's crucial to verify the compatibility of the wrapped versions of your tokens on the Sei chain. For the best bridging experience, visit the [official Sei Bridge app](https://app.sei.io/bridge).

## Faucets

Faucets are available for acquiring small amounts of tokens on the Sei public devnet (arctic-1) for testing and development:
- [(Discord gated) STAKEME Faucet](https://sei-evm.faucetme.pro/)
- [(Github gated) NIMA Faucet](https://sei-faucet.nima.enterprises/)

For additional faucet resources, please refer to our [chain registry](https://github.com/sei-protocol/chain-registry/blob/main/chains.json).
