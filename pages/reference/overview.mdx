## API Reference

The **API Reference** includes detailed documentation for interacting with the Sei Network programmatically via REST and gRPC APIs. Youâ€™ll find endpoints for querying data, submitting transactions, and interacting with both Cosmos and EVM layers.
- **Cosmos Endpoints**: Provides APIs for core Cosmos functions like staking, governance, and chain queries.
- **EVM Endpoints**: Details APIs for interacting with Ethereum-compatible smart contracts deployed on the Sei network.

## EVM Precompiles

**EVM Precompiles** are built-in contracts within the EVM on Sei that provide optimized functionality for certain operations.

## Pointer Contracts

**Pointer Contracts** enable tokens to be used interoperably in both EVM and CosmWasm environments.
