# Reference Overview

Welcome to the **Reference** section of the Sei documentation. This section offers key technical resources for interacting with the Sei Network.

## Seid

**Seid** is the CLI for interacting with the Sei network. It allows you to manage nodes, query blockchain data, and handle transactions, providing essential tools for operating within the network.

## API Reference

The **API Reference** includes detailed documentation for interacting with the Sei Network programmatically via REST and gRPC APIs. You’ll find endpoints for querying data, submitting transactions, and interacting with both Cosmos and EVM layers.
- **Cosmos Endpoints**: Provides APIs for core Cosmos functions like staking, governance, and chain queries.
- **EVM Endpoints**: Details APIs for interacting with Ethereum-compatible smart contracts deployed on the Sei network.

## EVM Precompiles

**EVM Precompiles** are built-in contracts within the EVM on Sei that provide optimized functionality for certain operations.

## Pointer Contracts

**Pointer Contracts** enable tokens to be used interoperably in both EVM and CosmWasm environments.
