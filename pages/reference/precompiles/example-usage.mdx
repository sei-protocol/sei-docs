# Example Usage

The Sei precompiles can be used like any standard smart contract on the EVM. For example, using [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/), you can query and execute actions on a CosmWasm contract as follows:

## Setup

To install `ethers`, run the following command in your project directory terminal:

```bash
npm install ethers
npm install @sei-js/evm
```

Next, you'll need to use one of the precompiles in `EVM Precompiles` section. In this example, we're going to be using the [CosmWasm precompile](./cosmwasm.mdx):

```typescript copy
// Import Wasm precompile address and ABI
// View the entire ABI here: https://github.com/sei-protocol/sei-chain/tree/evm/precompiles/wasmd
import { WASM_PRECOMPILE_ABI, WASM_PRECOMPILE_ADDRESS } from "@sei-js/evm";
```

## Using the contract

Next, we'll set up a provider and contract to interact with the blockchain:

```typescript copy
import { ethers, toUtf8Bytes, toUtf8String } from "ethers";

// Using MetaMask as the signer and provider
const provider = new ethers.BrowserProvider(window.ethereum);
const signer = await provider.getSigner();

// Create a contract with the signer
const contract = new ethers.Contract(
  WASM_PRECOMPILE_ADDRESS,
  WASM_PRECOMPILE_ABI,
  signer
);
```

  If using MetaMask, the wallet must be switched to the Sei EVM Devnet chain.

#### Querying & Executing a CosmWasm Contract

Once you have the contract, you can query and execute messages to any CosmWasm smart contract.

```typescript copy
// Counter CosmWasm contract (used for testing on arctic-1)
// Replace with your contract as needed
const COUNTER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS =
  "sei1eyfccmjm6732k7wp4p6gdjwhxjwsvje44j0hfx8nkgrm8fs7vqfsy2jxff";

// Query to get the count on the counter contract
const queryMsg = { get_count: {} };
const queryResponse = await contract.query(
  COUNTER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
  toUtf8Bytes(JSON.stringify(queryMsg))
);
console.log(toUtf8String(queryResponse));

// Execute message to increment the count on the contract.
// No funds are attached since the increment method does not require sei.
const executeMsg = { increment: {} };
const executeResponse = await contract.execute(
  COUNTER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
  toUtf8Bytes(JSON.stringify(executeMsg)),
  toUtf8Bytes(JSON.stringify([])) // Used for sending funds if needed
);

// Wait for the transaction to be confirmed
await executeResponse.wait();
console.log(executeResponse);
```

### Executing a payable function
In this example, we execute the 'donate' method on our contract.
This is similar to the `increment` method, but also receives funds from the user and stores it in the contract.
```typescript copy
// Execute a message to donate to the contract.
const executeMsg = { donate: {} }

// Funds are attached via overrides. This example is specific to ethers.js
const overrides = {
    value: ethers.parseEther("3.2"), // Sending 3.2 sei
}
const executeResponse = await contract.execute(
    COUNTER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
    toUtf8Bytes(JSON.stringify(executeJSON)),
    toUtf8Bytes(JSON.stringify({denom: "usdc", amount: "100"})), // Also send 100 usdc
    overrides);

await executeResponse.wait();
const receipt = await provider.getTransactionReceipt(executionResponse.hash);
```

For payable contracts, Sei amounts have to be sent directly to the contract while other denoms should use the `coins` field.
