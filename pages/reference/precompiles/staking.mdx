# Staking Precompile

**Address**: `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001005`

This precompile allows EVM contracts to interact with Sei's staking module, enabling functionalities such as delegating tokens, querying validators, and more.

## Functions

### Transactions
- `delegate`: Allows a user to delegate a specified amount of tokens to a validator. This function will truncate the `msg.value` to 6 decimals to 

  ```solidity
  /// Delegates Sei to the specified validator.
  /// @dev This function truncates msg.value to 6 decimal places for interaction with the staking module
  /// @param valAddress The Sei address of the validator.
  /// @return Whether the delegation was successful.
  function delegate(
      string memory valAddress,
  ) payable external returns (bool success);
  ```

- `redelegate`: Enables the redelegation of tokens from one validator to another

  ```solidity
  /// Redelegates Sei from one validator to another.
  /// @dev The amount should be in 6 decimal precision, not 18. 1 SEI = 1_000_000 uSEI
  /// @param srcAddress The Sei address of the validator to move delegations from.
  /// @param dstAddress The Sei address of the validator to move delegations to.
  /// @param amount The amount of Sei to move from srcAddress to dstAddress.
  /// @return Whether the redelegation was successful.
  function redelegate(
      string memory srcAddress,
      string memory dstAddress,
      uint256 amount
  ) external returns (bool success);
  ```

- `undelegate`: Provides the functionality for a user to withdraw a specified amount of tokens from a validator
  ```solidity
  /// Undelegates Sei from the specified validator.
  /// @dev The amount should be in 6 decimal precision, not 18. 1 SEI = 1_000_000 uSEI
  /// @param valAddress The Sei address of the validator to undelegate from.
  /// @param amount The amount of Sei to undelegate.
  /// @return Whether the undelegation was successful.
  function undelegate(
      string memory valAddress,
      uint256 amount
  ) external returns (bool success);
  ```

### Queries
- `delegation`: Queries delegation for a given delegator and validator address
  ```solidity
  struct Delegation {
      Balance balance;
      DelegationDetails delegation;
  }

  struct Balance {
      uint256 amount;
      string denom;
  }

  struct DelegationDetails {
      string delegator_address;
      uint256 shares;
      uint256 decimals;
      string validator_address;
  }

  /// Queries delegation for a given delegator and validator address.
  /// @param delegatorAddress The x0 or Sei address of the delegator.
  /// @param valAddress The Sei address of the validator.
  /// @return The delegation information. Shares in DelegationDetails are usually returned as decimals.
  /// To calculate the actual amount, divide the shares by decimals.
  function delegation(
      address delegator,
      string memory valAddress
  ) external view returns (Delegation delegation);
