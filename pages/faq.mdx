### Is it possible to create a multisig account?
Yes, multisig accounts are natively supported. Here is a simple example of how you can set up a multisig account:

1. Add two accounts to your local keychain
```bash
seid keys add ms1
seid keys add ms2
```

2. Create a multisig account requiring the above 2 accounts
```bash
seid keys add ms1ms2 --multisig-threshold=2 --multisig=ms1,ms2
```

#### Signing and broadcasting a TX

1) Define an unsigned-tx.json file with your unsigned transaction
```json
{
    "body": {
        "messages": [
            {
                "@type": "/cosmos.bank.v1beta1.MsgSend",
                "from_address": "MULTI_SIG_ACCOUNT",
                "to_address": "DESIRED_DESTINATION_ADDRESS",
                "amount": [
                    {
                        "denom": "usei",
                        "amount": "10"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ],
        "memo": "",
        "timeout_height": "0",
        "extension_options": [],
        "non_critical_extension_options": []
    },
    "auth_info": {
        "signer_infos": [],
        "fee": {
            "amount": [
                {
                    "denom": "usei",
                    "amount": "100000"
                }
            ],
            "gas_limit": "200000",
            "payer": "",
            "granter": ""
        }
    },
    "signatures": []
}
```

2. Sign unsigned tx from both signers (see unsigned-tx.json) and output json files of signed tx's
```bash
seid tx sign unsigned-tx.json --multisig=multisigAccountName --from=ms1 --output-document=signer1_signedTx.json --node YOUR_RPC_URL
seid tx sign unsigned-tx.json --multisig=multisigAccountName --from=ms2 --output-document=signer2_signedTx.json --node YOUR_RPC_URL
```

3. Sign tx from multisig account and output to json file of signed tx
```bash
seid tx multisign unsigned-tx.json ms1ms2 signer1_signedTx.json signer2_signedTx.json > signedTx.json
```

4. Broadcast multisig tx
```bash
seid tx broadcast signedTx.json
```

### Where can I find examples?
We have some Typescript examples in the documentation for our JS library, SeiJS:
- [SeiJS TypeDocs Examples](https://sei-protocol.github.io/sei-js/pages/EXAMPLES.html)


To see other examples of how to interact with Sei, you can check out our js-examples repo.
- [@sei-js/examples](https://github.com/sei-protocol/js-examples)


### Where can I find chain and asset information
- [Sei chain registry](https://github.com/sei-protocol/chain-registry)


### Where can I find current rest and rpc urls?
Public endpoints for all sei chains can be found in the [Tools and Resources](/tools-and-resources#public-endpoints) section

### Is there a Sei faucet for getting testnet funds?
Yes, you can head to Sei Faucet to connect your wallet and request tokens from the faucet. Instructions are [here](/getting-tokens)

### Why did smart contract ran out of gas at 300,000?
For all the Sei provided public nodes, we have set a maximum gas of 300,000. If your contract requires more gas, you will need to set up your own node and rpc url.

Additionally it is important that you run all your smart contracts through rust-optimizer so that your gas is low and your contract is optimized.

### How can I create a wallet given a mnemonic seed phrase?

If you are using the seid CLI you can run:
```bash
seid keys add NAME --recover SEED_PHASE
```
to recover the account as a local account. (Replace NAME with anything you want to name this local account and SEED_PHASE with the seed phase.)

In the context of a Javascript application:
```ts
import { restoreWallet } from '@sei-js/core';

//Takes an optional account index
const wallet = await restoreWallet(YOUR_SEED_PHRASE, 2);

// Now your wallet can be used with other @sei-js helper functions
const client = await getSigningCosmWasmClient(RPC_URL, wallet);
```

### Resolving "ReferenceError: process is not defined"
The "ReferenceError: process is not defined" error often occurs when developing web3 applications that rely on Node.js-specific libraries, such as process or Buffer. This error shows up because web browsers do not natively support these Node.js modules.
While the @sei-js package internally handles these discrepancies by including the necessary polyfills, you might encounter this or similar errors due to other third-party libraries not bundling those dependencies. When this happens, you'll have to manually include the required polyfills in your project.

If you are using Vite or rollup you can add the following to the entry point of your app.

```ts
import * as process from 'process';
import { Buffer } from 'buffer';

// Polyfill self for browser and global for Node.js
const globalObject = typeof self !== 'undefined' ? self : global;

Object.assign(globalObject, {
	process: process,
	Buffer: Buffer
});
```

If you are using Webpack you can use the following plugin in you Webpack config.
```bash
yarn add -D node-polyfill-webpack-plugin
```
```ts
import NodePolyfillPlugin from 'node-polyfill-webpack-plugin';

... // the rest of your webpack config
plugins: [
    ...
    new NodePolyfillPlugin(),
    ...
],
...
```
