# EVM RPC Endpoints
Below is a list of EVM-RPC endpoints provided by default on a Sei RPC node. Your RPC provider may offer slightly different/extended specifications.

All endpoints are in the form of JSON-RPC and share the following request/response structure:
- request
    - HTTP method: always "GET"
    - header: `accept: application/json`
    - header: `content-type: application/json`
    - body (JSON):
        - id: an arbitrary string identifier
        - jsonrpc: always "2.0"
        - method: endpoint name (e.g. "eth_sendRawTransaction")
        - params: an array that differs from endpoint to endpoint
- response
    - body (JSON):
        - id: the same identifier in request
        - jsonrpc: always "2.0"
        - result: an object that differs from endpoint to endpoint
 

## Send Transactions
### eth_sendRawTransaction

- param 1: string | hex-encoding of the signed transaction
- result: string | transaction hash

### sei_associate
Sends a transaction to establish association between the signer's Sei address and EVM address on-chain
- param 1: object
    - custom_message: any string message
    - r: the R-part of the signature over the Keccak256 hash of the custom message
