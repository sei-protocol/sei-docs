# Bridging to Sei Blockchain

To move assets onto the Sei Blockchain from another network, a variety of bridges are recommended via the Sei app. Here’s how it works:

1. Visit https://app.sei.io
2. Select the Source Chain - indicate the blockchain where your asset currently resides.

3. Choose Your Asset: Decide which asset you wish to bridge to the Sei blockchain. A smaller subsection of more liquid assets are included here, such as stablecoins. Always verify that the token you are bridging is correct.

4. Bridging Recommendation: Based on your asset and its origin chain, the Sei app will suggest a third-party bridge site. 

To begin with, we recommend using [Squid](https://www.squidrouter.com/) to bridge your assets. As more bridges come online, they will be added to the bridge tab on the Sei App.

    While bridge providers will always endeavour to eliminate bridge risks, when it comes to bridging users should always do their own research.

### Gas on Arrival Features

Some recommended bridges, will offer "gas on arrival" features. This can be particularly helpful by providing you with a small amount of Sei tokens to cover your initial transaction fees.
