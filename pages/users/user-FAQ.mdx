### I already have a Compass Wallet. How do I find my EVM / 0x address?

Simply open compass wallet and click the "Receive" button, and you will see both your Sei and 0x (EVM) addresses available to copy. Both addresses point to the same account.

### How can I link my EVM / 0x and Sei addresses? 

You can use the Sei App to link your addresses. More information and a step by step guide is available in the [Linking Addresses](/user-guides/linking-addresses) user guide.
