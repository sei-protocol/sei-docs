# Sei is built for developers

Sei is a high-performance, low-fee, designated proof-of-stake blockchain designed for developers. It supports optimistic parallel execution of both EVM and CosmWasm, opening up new design possibilities. With unique optimizations like twin turbo consensus and SeiDB, Sei ensures consistent 400ms block times and a transaction throughput that’s orders of magnitude higher than Ethereum. This means faster, more cost-effective operations. Plus, Sei’s seamless interoperability between EVM and CosmWasm gives developers native access to the entire Cosmos ecosystem, including IBC tokens, multi-sig accounts, fee grants, and more.


## Features

Sei incorporates a range of features that enhance its functionality and appeal to developers:

- **SeiDB**: A highly efficient and scalable database designed to support the high throughput of the Sei blockchain, ensuring rapid state updates.
- **Twin Turbo Consensus**: A consensus mechanism that accelerates transaction processing and finality, ensuring rapid and secure operations.
- **Parallel Execution**: The ability to process multiple transactions and smart contracts concurrently, significantly boosting performance.
- **Interoperability**: Native support for interactions between the EVM side and the Cosmos side within the same chain, making it easier to integrate functionalities from both ecosystems.

## EVM/CosmWasm Interoperability

Sei provides precompile contracts that facilitate many common Cosmos calls via the EVM, including:

- **IBC**: For inter-chain communication.
- **Wasm: For interactions with CosmWasm smart contracts including CW20 and CW721**
- **Bank**: For managing token transfers.
- **Staking**: For delegating and managing delegations.
- **Governance**: For participating in governance processes.
- **Oracle**: For fetching external data.
- **And More**

### Cross-Chain Token Functionality

Sei supports full interoperability of Sei native and CosmWasm tokens with the EVM and EVM RPC via pointer contacts, enabling EVM dApps access to many new tokens including:

- **ERC20 to CW20 tokens**
- **CW721 and ERC721 tokens**
- **IBC tokens**
- **TokenFactory tokens**
- **CW2981 and ERC2981 tokens** (with royalties)
