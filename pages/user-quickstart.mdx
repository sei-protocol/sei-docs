# Getting Started with Sei

Welcome to the newly upgraded Sei chain! 

This basic guide is intended for new users to start using Sei, no matter the experience level. Here’s how to get started.

## Requirements

- A compatible non-custodial wallet, such as [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), or [Compass](https://compasswallet.io/).
- Sei tokens [from an exchange](https://www.docs.sei.io/getting-tokens/mainnet-tokens), or stablecoins in your personal wallet.

For help with wallet apps, see our [Setting up a Wallet](https://www.docs.sei.io/setting-up-a-wallet) guide.

## Bridging assets to Sei network

To move assets betweeen Sei and another network, a variety of bridges are accessible via the [Sei web-app](https://app.sei.io/bridge). Here’s how it works:

- **Ensure you have a compatible wallet for both networks**, and that it is connected using the 'connect wallet' button.
- **Select the Origin Chain:** Select the blockchain where the asset resides.
- **Choose Your Asset:** Choose a supported asset to move.
- **Confirm all of the displayed information carefully:** Before approving any request on the wallet app, ensure the receiving address and amounts are correct.

Bridging Recommendation: Based on your asset and its origin chain, the Sei app will suggest a third-party bridge site. While third-party bridge providers always endeavour to eliminate bridge risks, users should always exercise caution by researching and understanding the associated trust assumptions and risks.

## Gas on Arrival Features

Some recommended bridges, such as Stargate and Squid Router, offer "gas on arrival" features. This can be particularly helpful by providing you with a small amount of Sei tokens to cover your initial transaction fees.

## Onboarding from Centralized Exchanges

If you’re coming to Sei from a centralized exchange, the transition to using both Sei and 0x wallet addresses on the Sei blockchain is straightforward. Over time, these exchanges will upgrade their systems to support both types of addresses.

- **Withdrawing to a Sei address:** Users can simply copy their address starting with “sei…” and paste it into the withdrawal page on their chosen CEX.
- **Withdrawing to an 0x address:** If you currently have an 0x address and wish to onboard to Sei from a CEX, follow these steps:

Visit the Dashboard page on the Sei app. Enter your 0x wallet address, and the app will automatically provide you with the corresponding Sei address derived from the same public key.

## Dual Address/Wallet Support

Sei v2 introduces a significant upgrade: "Ethereum" or [EVM] support. This means you can interact with the Sei network using two types of wallet addresses:

- **Hex address:** Commonly used in the Ethereum ecosystem, these are prefixed with with "0x".
- **Bech32 address:** Canonical to the Sei blockchain, these are prefixed with "sei1".

Both address types are supported, and you can easily find the corresponding wallet address to your existing sei or 0x wallet address on the Sei app. 
Importantly, both addresses are derived from the same public key, ensuring a seamless integration of your assets across both address formats.

## Connecting Your Wallet to Sei

When you connect your wallet to an application on Sei, you should automatically be prompted to join the correct network in your wallet interface. If this is not the case, you can find network details [here](https://www.docs.sei.io/setting-up-a-wallet) to manually add Sei.

Please follow the instructions shared by your chosen wallet provider to add a new network manually.

## Linking Wallet Addresses

If you have followed the steps above correctly, you can now link your 0x and Sei addresses by initiating any kind of transaction, such as a simple token transfer. You will be prompted to sign an additional transaction to link your wallets.

Note: You will require at least 1 SEI token in your wallet to link your wallets.
