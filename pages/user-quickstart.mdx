# Getting Started with Sei

Welcome to the newly upgraded Sei V2 blockchain. 

This basic guide is intended for new users to start using Sei, even if you are completely new to the blockchain space.

By the end of this guide, you will be ready to dive into the exciting world of applications and activities on Sei.

## Requirements

- A compatible non-custodial wallet, such as [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), or [Compass](https://compasswallet.io/).
- Sei tokens [from an exchange](https://www.docs.sei.io/getting-tokens/mainnet-tokens), or stablecoins in your personal wallet.

For help with wallet apps, see our [Setting up a Wallet](https://www.docs.sei.io/setting-up-a-wallet) guide.

## Dual Address/Wallet Support

Sei V2 introduces a significant upgrade: "Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)" support. This means you can interact with the Sei network using two types of wallet addresses:

- **EVM / 0x address:** Addresses used by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), these are prefixed with with "0x".
- **Sei address:** Canonical to the Sei blockchain, these are prefixed with "sei1".

Both address types are supported, and you can easily find the corresponding wallet address to your existing sei or 0x wallet address on the Sei app. 
Importantly, both addresses are derived from the same public key, ensuring a seamless integration of your assets across both address formats.

For a deeper dive into interoperability, check out our detailed article [here](https://blog.sei.io/sei-v2-interoperability/).

## Connecting Your Wallet to Sei

When you connect your wallet to an application on Sei, you should automatically be prompted to join the correct network in your wallet interface. If this is not the case, you can find network details [here](https://www.docs.sei.io/setting-up-a-wallet) to manually add Sei.

Please follow the instructions shared by your chosen wallet provider to add a new network manually.

## Linking Wallet Addresses

If you have followed the steps above correctly, you can now link your EVM / 0x and Sei addresses by initiating any kind of transaction, such as a simple token transfer. You will be prompted to sign an additional transaction to link your wallets. You can also use the Sei App to link your addresses. More information and a step by step guide is available in the [Linking Addresses](/user-guides/linking-addresses) user guide.

Note: You will require at least 1 SEI token in your account to link your addresses.

By following this guide, you should now be equipped to navigate the Sei Blockchain v2 with ease. Whether you're onboarding via a bridge or an exchange, the Sei Blockchain offers a flexible and user-friendly platform for managing your digital assets.
