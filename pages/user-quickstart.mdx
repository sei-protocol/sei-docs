# Getting Started with Sei

Welcome to the newly upgraded Sei V2 blockchain.

This basic guide is intended for new users to start using Sei, even if you are completely new to the blockchain space.

By the end of this guide, you will be ready to dive into the exciting world of applications and activities on Sei.

## Requirements
- A compatible non-custodial wallet, such as [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), or [Compass](https://compasswallet.io/).
- Sei tokens [from an exchange](/user-guides/getting-tokens), or stablecoins in your personal wallet.

For help with wallet apps, see our [Setting up a Wallet](/user-guides/wallet-setup) guide.

## Connecting Your Wallet to the Sei Network

When you connect your wallet to an application on Sei, you should automatically be prompted to join the correct network in your wallet interface.


<Callout emoji="üí°">
  You can try out connecting to the Sei blockchain network by clicking the "Connect Wallet" button on the Sei App at https://app.sei.io
</Callout>

If your wallet does not prompt you to join the Sei Network, you can find network details [here](/user-guides/wallet-setup) to manually add Sei network.

Please follow the instructions shared by your chosen wallet provider to add a new network manually.

## Dual Address/Wallet Support

Sei V2 introduces a significant upgrade: "Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)" support. This means you can interact with the Sei network using two types of wallet addresses:

- **EVM / 0x address:** Addresses used by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), these are prefixed with with "0x".
- **Sei address:** Canonical to the Sei blockchain, these are prefixed with "sei1".

Both address types are supported, and you can easily find the corresponding wallet address to your existing sei or 0x wallet address on the Sei app.
Importantly, both addresses are derived from the same public key, ensuring a seamless integration of your assets across both address formats.

For a deeper dive into interoperability, check out our detailed article [here](https://blog.sei.io/sei-v2-interoperability/).

## Linking Wallet Addresses

In order to start using apps on Sei that leverage v2 interoperability, users must link their wallet addresses. Each Sei address in Sei V2 has a corresponding EVM / 0x address, and vice versa. When you use Sei V2 for the first time, it is necessary to link these two addresses.

<Callout type="warning">
  **Important Note:** You cannot decide which Sei and 0x addresses are linked together. Each Sei account has exactly one specific Sei address, and one specific EVM / 0x address, associated with it. They are like 2 sides of the same coin, and cannot be combined with other addresses.
</Callout>

You can link your Sei and EVM / 0x addresses using the Sei app.

1. Navigate to https://app.sei.io/ using your web browser.
2. On the Dashboard, look for the "Addresses" box.
3. Complete captcha, if required.
3. Click the "Link Addresses" button.

This will prompt you to sign a message with your wallet - it's not a transaction, and will not charge you any gas fees.
<ImageWithCaption img={signMessageImage} alt="Sign message"/>
4. Once you have signed that message, your accounts will be linked!
<ImageWithCaption img={linkSuccessImage} alt="Linking successful"/>

More information and a step by step guide is available in the [Linking Addresses](/user-guides/linking-addresses) user guide.

Congratulations, you have now linked your Sei and EVM/0x addresses.

<Callout emoji="üí°">
    It is recommended that every Sei user goes through this process; many apps on Sei utilize cross VM functionality and will only work if you have completed this user flow.
</Callout>

## Onboarding from Centralized Exchanges

If you‚Äôre coming to Sei from a centralized exchange, the transition to using both Sei and 0x wallet addresses on the Sei blockchain is straightforward. Over time, these exchanges will upgrade their systems to support both types of addresses.

### Withdrawing to a Sei Address

Users can simply copy their address starting with ‚Äúsei‚Ä¶‚Äù and paste into the withdrawal page on their chosen CEX.

<ImageWithCaption img={cexWithdrawImage} alt="Withdraw Sei from Cex"/>

No memo is required to withdraw from a CEX, however it is likely you will need to provide a memo when depositing Sei back onto a CEX. Refer to your chosen CEX‚Äôs guidelines to ensure your assets are transferred safely.

### Withdrawing to an EVM/0x Address

While CEXes integrate with Sei V2, users will have to perform the following steps in order to get started on Sei with a Metamask or other EVM wallet.

If you currently have an 0x address and wish to onboard to Sei from a CEX, you will need to find your corresponding Sei address first - you can do this by linking your addresses using the steps in the [Linking Addresses User Guide.](/user-guides/linking-addresses)

If you are not sure if your addresses are linked, visit the Dashboard page on the [Sei App](https://app.sei.io). You will be able to see both of your addresses if already linked, otherwise you will be prompted to sign and link your 0x and Sei addresses.

## Bridging to Sei Blockchain

To move assets onto the Sei Blockchain from another network, a variety of bridges are recommended via the Sei app. Here‚Äôs how it works:

1. Visit https://app.sei.io
2. Select the Source Chain - indicate the blockchain where your asset currently resides.
<ImageWithCaption img={sourceChainDropdownImage} alt="Select a source chain"/>
3. Choose Your Asset: Decide which asset you wish to bridge to the Sei blockchain. A smaller subsection of more liquid assets are included here, such as stablecoins. Always verify that the token you are bridging is correct.¬†¬†

    NB: Assets pictured are for illustrative purposes only and may not be supported at present. Check the Sei app to see what options are available to you.
</Callout>
<ImageWithCaption img={selectAssetImage} alt="Select an asset"/>
4. Bridging Recommendation: Based on your asset and its origin chain, the Sei app will suggest a third-party bridge site.

To begin with, we recommend using [Squid](https://www.squidrouter.com/) to bridge your assets. As more bridges come online, they will be added to the bridge tab on the Sei App.

<Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
    While bridge providers will always endeavour to eliminate bridge risks, when it comes to bridging users should always do their own research.
</Callout>

### Gas on Arrival Features

Some recommended bridges, will offer "gas on arrival" features. This can be particularly helpful by providing you with a small amount of Sei tokens to cover your initial transaction fees.

## Viewing Assets in your Wallet

As a source of truth, users should navigate to a v2 block explorer such as [seitrace.com](https://www.seitrace.com).

This new explorer supports both EVM and Native Sei.

Simply search for your wallet address to view the assets you're currently holding in that address. You can import tokens to Metamask using the contract addresses you find here, find out more at this link: https://support.metamask.io/managing-my-tokens/custom-tokens/how-to-display-tokens-in-metamask/

## Conclusion
By following this guide, you should now be equipped to navigate the Sei Blockchain v2 with ease. Whether you're onboarding via a bridge or an exchange, the Sei Blockchain offers a flexible and user-friendly platform for managing your digital assets.
