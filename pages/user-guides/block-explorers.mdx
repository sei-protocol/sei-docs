# Block Explorers

## **What Is a Block Explorer?**

Rather than downloading the entire blockchain ledger, using a block explorer is the most common method to look up all kinds of useful on-chain information.

Most block explorers offer tools for viewing, and sometimes even interacting with the network including:

- Transaction Tracking: View and track individual transactions on the blockchain. Typically includes information such as transaction hashes, input and output data, the address of other wallets or contracts a given wallet has interacted with, tokens transferred, fees paid and any error messages that may be associated with the transaction.

- Block Information: Details about each block like height (sequence), timestamp, total size, and details on transactions included in each block.

- Address Queries: Find specific wallet addresses, with token balances and transaction history, details on contract addresses and non-wallet accounts.

- Network Statistics: Statistics and analytics about the blockchain, such as total number of blocks, transaction throughput, network hash rate, staking and governance data, and much more.

- Smart Contracts: Query smart contract states, deployments and interactions with other wallets or addresses. Some may include the raw code for the contract.

  Note: In rare cases, some information may be misinterpreted. Off-chain data should be used as a guide only.
