# Block Explorers

## What Is a Block Explorer?

Rather than downloading the entire blochain ledger, using a block explorer is the most common method to look up all sort of on-chain information. 
Most block explorers offer tools for viewing and sometimes even interacting with the network including:

- Transaction Tracking: View and track individual transactions on the blockchain. This includes information such as transaction hashes, input and output data, amounts transferred and fees
- 
- Block Information: Provide detailed information about blocks, including block height, timestamp, size, and the transactions included in each block.
- 
- Address Queries: Look up specific wallet addresses to see their balances and transaction history
- Network Statistics: Statistics and analytics about the blockchain network, such as the total number of 
- blocks, transaction throughput, network hash rate, and current difficulty.
5. Smart Contract Interaction: Display information about smart contract deployments and interactions, including the code of the contract and executed actions.
