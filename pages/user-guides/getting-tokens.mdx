## Acquiring tokens on Sei Networks

### Centralized Exchanges

Purchasing SEI through centralized exchanges is the easiest method. $SEI is available on several major exchanges including:
- [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en-CA/how-to-buy/sei)
- [BitGet](https://www.bitget.com/web3/academy/experience-sei)
- [KuCoin](https://www.kucoin.com/how-to-buy/sei)

### Bridging

Bridging is essential for transferring tokens between different blockchains. This allows you to utilize tokens from various chains on the Sei network in their wrapped forms. It's crucial to verify the compatibility of the wrapped versions of your tokens on the Sei chain.

For the best bridging experience, visit the [Sei Bridge page](https://app.sei.io/bridge).

### Faucets

Faucets dispensing small amounts of tokens for development/testing are available on both the public testnet (atlantic-2) and devnet (arctic-1).

These tokens bear no value, however please utilize small amounts when possible, as the supplied amounts are limited and the faucets all Discord-gated (unless specified).
