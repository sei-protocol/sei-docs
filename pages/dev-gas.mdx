# Gas on Sei

Gas refers to the unit of measurement representing the work done to execute some transaction on the blockchain. The amount of gas used varies based on the complexity of the transaction.

When submitting a TX to be broadcast, users specify the gas price and the gas limit (sometimes shortened to ‘gas’).

The gas price refers to the amount of sei the user pays per gas used. In a proof of stake chain like Sei, increasing the gas price provides a greater incentive for validators to execute your transaction, ensuring shorter time to finality when the chain is congested.

The gas limit is the maximum amount of gas the user wants the transaction to use. If the gas limit is set too low, the node attempting to run the transaction will run out of gas and fail to complete the transaction.

The gas limit is multiplied by the gas price to create the ‘fee’. In the event that the validator successfully executes your transaction, the fee is paid in full to the validator (regardless of how much gas was actually used).

Sei has minimum gas prices per chain, which can be found in the official [chain registry](https://github.com/sei-protocol/chain-registry/blob/main/gas.json).
