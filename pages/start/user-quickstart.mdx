# Connect to Sei

Welcome to Sei!

This getting started guide will help you set up your wallet and start using Sei, even if you're new to blockchain. By the end, you'll be ready to explore the most performant blockchain ever.

## Requirements

- A compatible, non-custodial wallet, such as [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), or [Compass](https://compasswallet.io/).
- Sei tokens [from an exchange](/users/getting-tokens), or stablecoins in your personal wallet.

For additional help with wallet apps, see our [Setting up a Wallet](/users/wallet-setup) guide.

## Connecting Your Wallet

When you connect your wallet to an application on Sei, you'll automatically be prompted to join 
the correct network within your wallet interface.

To test this, simply click the "Connect Wallet" button on the Sei App at [app.sei.io](https://app.sei.io/).
If you'd like to jump right in, the demo below walks you through how to connect to the Sei network.
> Please follow the instructions shared by your chosen wallet provider to add a new network manually.
> If your wallet does not prompt you to join the Sei Network, you can find network details [here](/user-guides/wallet-setup) to manually add Sei network.

### Dual Address Support

Sei supports two wallet address types:

- **EVM (0x) address:** Ethereum-style addresses prefixed with "0x".
- **Sei address:** Native Sei blockchain addresses prefixed with "sei1".

Both addresses are derived from the same public key, ensuring seamless asset integration across formats. 
You can find your corresponding wallet addresses directly in the Sei app.

For more details on interoperability, explore our article [here](https://blog.sei.io/sei-v2-interoperability/).

## Linking Wallet Addresses

<Callout emoji="💡">
    Many Sei apps require linked addresses for cross-VM functionality. It’s recommended for all users.
</Callout>

To use Sei apps that leverage interoperability, you must link your Sei and EVM (0x) addresses. Each Sei address has a corresponding EVM address, and vice versa. This link is required the first time you use Sei.

<Callout type="warning">
  You cannot choose which addresses are linked. 
  Each Sei account has one specific Sei address and one specific EVM address, derived from the same public key.
</Callout>

### How to Link Your Addresses

1. Navigate to [app.sei.io](https://app.sei.io) using your web browser.
2. On the Dashboard, look for the "Addresses" box.
3. Complete captcha, if required.
3. Click the "Link Addresses" button. This will prompt you to sign a message with your wallet - it's not a transaction,
and will not charge you any gas fees.
4. Once you have signed that message, your accounts will be linked.

For more details, check the [Linking Addresses guide](/user-guides/linking-addresses).

## Onboarding from Centralized Exchanges

If you're transitioning from a CEX, using both Sei and 0x addresses is simple. CEXs will upgrade to support both over time.

### Withdrawing to a Sei Address

Copy your **sei1...** address and paste it into the withdrawal page of your CEX.

<ImageWithCaption img={cexWithdrawImage} alt="Withdraw Sei from Cex"/>

No memo is required for withdrawals, but depositing back to a CEX may require a memo. Check your CEX's guidelines to ensure smooth transfers.

### Withdrawing to an EVM/0x Address

To withdraw to an 0x address, you must first link it to your Sei address. Follow the steps in the [Linking Addresses guide](/user-guides/linking-addresses).

If your addresses aren't linked, visit the Dashboard on the [Sei App](https://app.sei.io) to check or link them.

## Bridging to Sei

To move assets to Sei from another network, use one of the recommended bridges via the Sei app:

1. Go to [app.sei.io](https://app.sei.io).
2. Select the **Source Chain** (where your assets currently reside).
<ImageWithCaption img={sourceChainDropdownImage} alt="Select a source chain"/>
3. Choose the asset you want to bridge (e.g., stablecoins). Verify the token. 
<Callout emoji="⚠️">
    NB: Assets pictured are for illustrative purposes only and may not be supported at present. 
    Check the Sei app to see what options are available to you.
</Callout>
<ImageWithCaption img={selectAssetImage} alt="Select an asset"/>
4. The app will recommend a bridge based on the asset and origin chain.

We recommend [Squid](https://www.squidrouter.com/) for initial bridging. New bridges will be added over time.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    While bridge providers work to minimize risks, always conduct your own due diligence and research before 
    engaging in bridging.
</Callout>

### Gas on Arrival

Some bridges offer "gas on arrival," providing small amounts of Sei tokens to cover your initial transaction fees.

## Viewing Assets in Your Wallet

To view your assets, use a block explorer like [seitrace.com](https://www.seitrace.com). 
This explorer supports both EVM and native Sei addresses.

This new explorer supports both EVM and Native Sei.

Simply search for your wallet address to view your holdings. To import tokens into MetaMask, use the contract addresses found in the explorer. Learn more [here](https://support.metamask.io/managing-my-tokens/custom-tokens/how-to-display-tokens-in-metamask/).
