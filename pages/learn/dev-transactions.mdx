# Transactions

Transactions are essential on the Sei blockchain for any state updates, including token transfers, account linking, and smart contract execution. While creating an account doesn’t require a transaction, associating an account with blockchain actions does.

Each transaction is signed with the sender’s private key to verify authenticity and ownership. For more on private keys, see [HD Paths and Coin Types](/dev-advanced-concepts/hd-path-coin-types).

## Transaction Types

Since Sei supports both EVM and Cosmos SDK transactions, there are different transaction types based on the execution environment. The following sections provide an overview of Cosmos and EVM transactions on Sei.

### Cosmos Transactions

Cosmos transactions are used for interacting with Cosmos-based RPCs and tooling. They consist of the **body**, **auth info**, and **signatures**.

#### Signing Cosmos Transactions

Cosmos transactions on the Sei blockchain follow the standard Cosmos SDK format. They include various types of messages that can be included in the transaction body.

Using the `seid` CLI, you can use the `--generate-only` flag to generate an unsigned transaction in JSON format. The transaction can then be signed and broadcast to the network.

`seid tx sign unsigned_tx.json --chain-id my-test-chain --keyring-backend test --from $SIGNER_ADDRESS`

### EVM Transactions

The Sei blockchain supports Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) transactions, allowing compatibility with Ethereum-based tools and contracts. EVM transactions follow a different structure compared to Cosmos transactions.
