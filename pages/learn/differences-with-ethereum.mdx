# Divergence from Ethereum

Sei features full EVM compatibility but makes different design choices compared to Ethereum. Below are some high-level contrasts for general users:

## EVM Differences

Unlike Ethereum mainnet (currently at Cancun), Sei uses the Shanghai version of the EVM. This means some Ethereum Cancun features (such as blob transactions) are **not** supported on Sei.

## Base Fee & Tips

Sei’s base fee is always **0**—all fees go directly to the validators as tips (none are burned). Ethereum’s base fee (introduced in EIP-1559) adjusts dynamically and is partially burned.

## Block Limit

Sei has a gas limit of 10M on mainnet, whereas Ethereum’s limit is around 30M. Additionally, Sei enforces a byte-size limit of 21MB per block, which does not exist on Ethereum.

## Finality

Sei’s Tendermint consensus provides near-instant finality for blocks. On Ethereum, blocks are typically “finalized” over time and can, in theory, be reorganized until they are finalized.

For a deeper dive into opcode differences, block hashing, or the AVL-based state root, see the **Build** docs.
