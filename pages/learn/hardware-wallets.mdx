# Hardware Wallet Setup

Signing transactions manually or using hardware wallets like Ledger ensures secure transaction approval. To sign Sei transactions on a Ledger device, you must install the **Cosmos** or **Sei** app (depending on the firmware/support) and interact with a compatible RPC or wallet interface.

## Requirements

- Ledger hardware wallet (Nano S, Nano X, or similar)
- [Ledger Live](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live) installed
- USB cable (or Bluetooth for Ledger Nano X)
- Latest Ledger firmware + installed apps
- An internet connection
- A compatible Sei wallet application (MetaMask, Compass, etc.)

## Installing the Sei or Cosmos App on Ledger

1. **Open Ledger Live**  
   Download and install [Ledger Live](https://www.ledger.com/start). Set it up and connect your Ledger device.

2. **Manager Section**  
   Go to the **Manager** tab in Ledger Live.

3. **Install App**  
   - Ensure your Ledger is unlocked.  
   - Search for “Sei” (if available) or “Cosmos,” depending on the official release state.  
   - Click **Install** to add the app to your Ledger.

Linux users: You may need to add a `udev` rule to allow device access. See Ledger's

## Using a Ledger Device with MetaMask

1. **Install MetaMask**  
   Make sure you have the [MetaMask extension](https://metamask.io/) installed in your browser.

2. **Connect Hardware Wallet**  
   In MetaMask, open the account menu and select **Connect Hardware Wallet**. Follow prompts to connect your Ledger.

3. **Unlock and Select Account**  
   Unlock your Ledger device, ensure the Sei (or Cosmos) app is open, and pick the correct derivation/account in MetaMask.

4. **Sign Transactions**  
   Now, any transaction initiated in MetaMask for the Sei network will prompt you to confirm it on your Ledger device.

## Using a Ledger Device with Compass

1. **Add Hardware Wallet**  
   In Compass, choose **Add Account** (or similar) and select the hardware wallet option.

2. **Connect Ledger**  
   Follow instructions to connect your Ledger and select the correct account path.

3. **Secure Signatures**  
   All transactions triggered in Compass will require physical confirmation on your Ledger.

## Viewing Balances & Receiving Assets

1. **Open Your Wallet**  
   Whether you use MetaMask, Compass, or another wallet, make sure your Ledger device is unlocked with the Sei app open.

2. **Check Balances**  
   The wallet should display your SEI or other tokens. Balances update automatically after transactions or deposits.

3. **Receive Assets**  
   - Use the **Receive** or **Deposit** section in your wallet.  
   - Verify the displayed address on both your computer **and** the Ledger’s screen.  
   - Share that address with the sender or use it for exchange withdrawals.

<Callout type='warning'>
Always verify the receiving address on the Ledger device itself to prevent address spoofing or phishing.

## Sending Assets

1. **Initiate Send**  
   Choose the **Send** function in your chosen wallet, input the destination address, amount, etc.

2. **Confirm on Ledger**  
   The transaction details (address, amount, fees) should appear on your Ledger. Verify each field carefully.

3. **Approve & Broadcast**  
   Press the Ledger buttons to confirm the transaction. Your transaction is then broadcast to the Sei network.

<Callout type='warning'>
Carefully check all transaction data on your Ledger. This final confirmation step helps prevent errors and malicious tampering.

- **Ledger**: [Ledger Support](https://support.ledger.com/)
- **Wallet Apps**: Check each application’s official docs for troubleshooting.

<Callout type='error'>
Never share your Ledger recovery phrase with anyone. Keep it offline in a secure place. This seed phrase is your last resort for wallet recovery if the device is lost or damaged.
