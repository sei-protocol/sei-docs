# About Sei

Parallel execution, high throughput and unified VM operability establish Sei as the standard for a scalable EVM and for interconnected blockchain ecosystems.

Sei’s twin-turbo consensus and SeiDB achieve 400-millisecond block times and deliver transaction throughput tailored for high-demand blockchain environments. Advancements in performance position Sei as a pivotal force in cross-disciplinary distributed computing and redefine EVM capabilities. The design enables complex real-world decentralized applications and sets a new benchmark for blockchain technology.

Sei’s architecture offers seamless interoperability and gives EVM developers native access to the Cosmos ecosystem with IBC tokens, multi-sig accounts and fee grants. Pointer Contracts and Precompile Contracts bridge EVM and CosmWasm and enable smooth interaction with assets ranging from ERC20 to CW20 tokens and CW721 to ERC721 NFTs without sacrificing performance. Integrating IBC and Wasm directly into the EVM through Precompile Contracts strengthens cross-VM functionality. 

## What is the EVM?

The EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) is used to process transactions in blockchains such as Ethereum. Most crypto native developers are extremely familiar with the EVM.

Unfortunately, the EVM is quite inefficient - on Ethereum L1, it's not able to process more than ~20 TPS.

This results in

- high transaction fees for users, often going into hundreds of dollars for simple transactions
- a restricted design space for developers, who are unable to build high performance applications

## What is parallelization?

Parallelization lets you process multiple things at the same time (i.e. in parallel). This is commonly used in software engineering to take advantage of modern hardware (which has multiple cores) to process multiple workstreams at the same time.

For Sei, parallelization is used to process multiple independent transactions at the same time.

## What optimizations does Sei introduce?

Sei introduces four major innovations:

- **Twin Turbo Consensus**: This feature allows Sei to reach the fastest time to finality of any blockchain at 400ms, unlocking web2 like experiences for applications.
- **Optimistic Parallelization**: This feature allows developers to unlock parallel processing for their Ethereum applications, with no additional work.
- **SeiDB**: This major upgrade allows Sei to handle the much higher rate of data storage, reads and writes which become extremely important for a high performance blockchain.
- **Interoperable EVM**: This allows existing developers in the Ethereum ecosystem to deploy their applications, tooling and infrastructure to Sei with no changes, while benefiting from the 100x performance improvements offered by Sei.

All these features combine to unlock a brand new, scalable design space for the Ethereum Ecosystem.

## Sei performance metrics

With these performance optimizations, Sei is able to get

- 400 millisecond time to finality
- 5,030 transactions per second (12,500 theoretical max)

## What are the benefits of Sei?

Sei represents a 100x improvement on the EVM. This will unlock an entirely new design space for application developers, and make the EVM much cheaper to access for normal people.
