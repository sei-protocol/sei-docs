### Deploying Pointer Contracts

This section guides you through the process of deploying a Pointer Contract for
various token standards using the seid CLI tool.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">

</Callout>

#### Prerequisites

The list of requirements for deploying a pointer is fairly short:

- Sei light client (CLI/daemon) installed on your machine. You can follow the
  [installation guide](./installing-seid.mdx) if needed.
- Address for the relevant contract (the "pointee")

When a pointer is registered for any given contract, the two are mapped and
identifiable across both execution environments. This link is immutable and can
only be changed through governance.

Before deploying a pointer, you should first check if a pointer for the
token/contract you wish to deploy already exists, using this query:

```bash
seid q evm pointer [type] [pointee] [flags]
```

**Arguments**

- `TYPE`: One of "ERC20", "ERC721", "NATIVE", "CW20", and "CW721". Note that
  type refers to the underlying token type, so a type of "ERC20" refers to a
  CosmWasm pointer pointing to an ERC-20 token.
- `POINTEE`: the underlying token denom literal in the case of "NATIVE" type, or
  the underlying token contract address for all other types

**Flags**

- `--evm-rpc`: The endpoint URL for the EVM RPC interface of the Sei blockchain.
  This URL is used by the `seid` command to interact with the Sei EVM.

## Deploying a Pointer Contract

To deploy a Pointer Contract that links to a CosmWasm contract, you can use the
following command:

```bash
seid tx evm register-evm-pointer [pointer type] [cw-address] --gas-fee-cap=<int> --gas-limit=<int>
```

#### Arguments

- `pointer type`: The type of pointer you want to create, either CW20, CW721, or
  NATIVE.
- `cw-address`: The address of the CosmWasm contract you want to create an EVM
  pointer for.

#### Flags

- `--gas-fee-cap`: The maximum amount of gas fees that can be charged for the
  transaction.
- `--gas-limit`: The maximum amount of gas that can be consumed by the
  transaction.
- `--evm-rpc`: The endpoint URL for the EVM RPC interface of the Sei blockchain.
  This URL is used by the `seid` command to interact with the Sei EVM.

### Confirmation

After initially registering a pointer, it is advisable to confirm registration
by using the following command:

```shell
Usage:
  seid query evm pointer [type] [pointee] [flags]
```

#### Arguments

- `pointer type`: The type of pointer you want to create, either CW20, CW721, or
  NATIVE.
- `cw-address`: The address of the CosmWasm contract you want to create an EVM
  pointer for.

#### Flags

- `--height int`: Use a specific height to query state at (this can error if the
  node is pruning state).

- `--node string`: `<host>:<port>` to Tendermint RPC interface for this chain

- `--output string`: Output format (text|json) (default "text").

<Callout type="info">
  For a quick-reference for flags/args and syntax, use the `--help` flag with any command. For example:

```bash
seid tx evm --help
```

</Callout>

## CosmWasm >> ERC Pointer

### For ERC20 Tokens

To deploy a CW20 Pointer Contract that links to an ERC20 token, you can use the
following command:

```bash
seid tx evm register-cw-pointer ERC20 $ERC20_TOKEN_ADDRESS --from=$SENDER --chain-id=pacific-1 --broadcast-mode=block --gas=200000 --fees=5000usei --node=https://rpc.sei-apis.com
```

#### Arguments

- `ERC20_TOKEN_ADDRESS`: The contract address of the ERC20 contract to create a
  CW20 pointer for.

#### Flags

- `--from`: Keyfile (by name) from which the tx is sent. This address must have
  enough balance to cover transaction fees.
- `--chain-id`: Identifies the specific chain of the Sei network you're
  interacting with. `pacific-1` refers to the Sei mainnet.
- `--broadcast-mode`: Determines how the transaction is broadcasted. Setting
  this to `block` means the transaction will wait to be included in a block
  before returning a response.
- `--gas`: Specifies the maximum amount of gas that can be consumed by the
  transaction.
- `--fees`: Indicates the transaction fee.
- `--node`: Points to the specific Sei node RPC URL you're connecting to for
  transaction submission.

  Source code for pointer contracts can be seen in the [contracts directory](https://github.com/sei-protocol/sei-chain/tree/main/contracts/src) of the [sei-chain](https://github.com/sei-protocol/sei-chain) repo.
</Callout>

### For ERC721 Tokens

To deploy a CW721 Pointer Contract that links to an ERC721 token, you can use
the following command:

```bash
seid tx evm register-cw-pointer ERC721 $ERC721_TOKEN_ADDRESS --from=$SENDER --chain-id=pacific-1 --broadcast-mode=block --gas=200000 --fees=5000usei --node=https://rpc.sei-apis.com
```

#### Arguments

- `ERC721_TOKEN_ADDRESS`: The contract address of the ERC721 token to create a
  CW721 pointer for.

#### Flags

- `--from`: Keyfile (by name) from which the tx is sent. This address must have
  enough balance to cover transaction fees.
- `--chain-id`: Identifies the specific chain of the Sei network you're
  interacting with. `pacific-1` refers to Sei mainnet.
- `--broadcast-mode`: Determines how the transaction is broadcasted. Setting
  this to `block` means the transaction will wait to be included in a block
  before returning a response.
- `--gas`: Specifies the maximum amount of gas that can be consumed by the
  transaction.
- `--fees`: Indicates the transaction fee.
- `--node`: Points to the specific Sei node RPC URL you're connecting to for
  transaction submission.

## ERC >> CosmWasm Pointer

```

#### Arguments
