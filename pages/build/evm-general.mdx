# EVM (general)
## Overview
The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the runtime environment for smart contracts, enabling compatibility with Ethereum-based dApps. Sei is an EVM compatible blockchain. Sei's parallelized EVM ensures high performance and efficiency.

Here are some key points about the EVM:

1. **Turing Completeness**: The EVM is Turing complete, meaning it can execute any computable function. This allows developers to write complex smart contracts.
2. **Gas**: Transactions and contract executions on the EVM compatible network consume gas. Gas is a measure of computational work, and users pay for it in usei on Sei networks . Gas ensures that malicious or inefficient code doesn’t overload the network.
3. **Bytecode Execution**: Smart contracts are compiled into bytecode (low-level machine-readable instructions) and deployed to the EVM compatible network. The EVM executes this bytecode.

## Smart contract languages

The two most popular languages for developing smart contracts on the EVM are **Solidity** and **Vyper**.

### Solidity

- Object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts.
- Curly-bracket language that has been most profoundly influenced by C++.
- Statically typed (the type of a variable is known at compile time).
- Supports:
  - Inheritance (you can extend other contracts).
  - Libraries (you can create reusable code that you can call from different contracts – like static functions in a static class in other object oriented programming languages).
  - Complex user-defined types.


#### Example solidity contract

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
pragma solidity >= 0.7.0;

contract Coin {
    // The keyword "public" makes variables
    // accessible from other contracts
    address public minter;
    mapping (address => uint) public balances;

    // Events allow clients to react to specific
    // contract changes you declare
    event Sent(address from, address to, uint amount);

    // Constructor code is only run when the contract
    // is created
    constructor() {
        minter = msg.sender;
    }

    // Sends an amount of newly created coins to an address
    // Can only be called by the contract creator
    function mint(address receiver, uint amount) public {
        require(msg.sender == minter);
        require(amount < 1e60);
        balances[receiver] += amount;
    }

    // Sends an amount of existing coins
    // from any caller to an address
    function send(address receiver, uint amount) public {
        require(amount <= balances[msg.sender], "Insufficient balance.");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        balances[receiver] += amount;
        emit Sent(msg.sender, receiver, amount);
    }
}
```

### Vyper

- Pythonic programming language
- Strong typing
- Small and understandable compiler code
- Efficient bytecode generation
- Deliberately has less features than Solidity with the aim of making contracts more secure and easier to audit. Vyper does not support:
  - Modifiers
  - Inheritance
  - Inline assembly
  - Function overloading
  - Operator overloading
  - Recursive calling
  - Infinite-length loops
  - Binary fixed points

#### Example Vyper contract

  ```python
  # Open Auction

  # Auction params
  # Beneficiary receives money from the highest bidder
  beneficiary: public(address)
  auctionStart: public(uint256)
  auctionEnd: public(uint256)

  # Current state of auction
  highestBidder: public(address)
  highestBid: public(uint256)

  # Set to true at the end, disallows any change
  ended: public(bool)

  # Keep track of refunded bids so we can follow the withdraw pattern
  pendingReturns: public(HashMap[address, uint256])

  # Create a simple auction with `_bidding_time`
  # seconds bidding time on behalf of the
  # beneficiary address `_beneficiary`.
  @external
  def __init__(_beneficiary: address, _bidding_time: uint256):
      self.beneficiary = _beneficiary
      self.auctionStart = block.timestamp
      self.auctionEnd = self.auctionStart + _bidding_time

  # Bid on the auction with the value sent
  # together with this transaction.
  # The value will only be refunded if the
  # auction is not won.
  @external
  @payable
  def bid():
      # Check if bidding period is over.
      assert block.timestamp < self.auctionEnd
      # Check if bid is high enough
      assert msg.value > self.highestBid
      # Track the refund for the previous high bidder
      self.pendingReturns[self.highestBidder] += self.highestBid
      # Track new high bid
      self.highestBidder = msg.sender
      self.highestBid = msg.value

  # Withdraw a previously refunded bid. The withdraw pattern is
  # used here to avoid a security issue. If refunds were directly
  # sent as part of bid(), a malicious bidding contract could block
  # those refunds and thus block new higher bids from coming in.
  @external
  def withdraw():
      pending_amount: uint256 = self.pendingReturns[msg.sender]
      self.pendingReturns[msg.sender] = 0
      send(msg.sender, pending_amount)

  # End the auction and send the highest bid
  # to the beneficiary.
  @external
  def endAuction():
      # It is a good guideline to structure functions that interact
      # with other contracts (i.e. they call functions or send ether)
      # into three phases:
      # 1. checking conditions
      # 2. performing actions (potentially changing conditions)
      # 3. interacting with other contracts
      # If these phases are mixed up, the other contract could call
      # back into the current contract and modify the state or cause
      # effects (ether payout) to be performed multiple times.
      # If functions called internally include interaction with external
      # contracts, they also have to be considered interaction with
      # external contracts.

      # 1. Conditions
      # Check if auction endtime has been reached
      assert block.timestamp >= self.auctionEnd
      # Check if this function has already been called
      assert not self.ended

      # 2. Effects
      self.ended = True

      # 3. Interaction
      send(self.beneficiary, self.highestBid)
    ```

## Deploying EVM contract on Sei

Since Sei is an EVM compatible chain, existing EVM tooling like [hardhat](https://hardhat.org/), [foundry forge](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) or other could be re-used.

In this example we will be using [foundry tooling](https://book.getfoundry.sh/).

Install the [foundry tooling](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) by following this [Installation guide](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation.html).

Create a new project following the [Creating New Project Guide](https://book.getfoundry.sh/projects/creating-a-new-project).

Also make sure you have a wallet on Sei network.

Once project is created, tweak the contract code to the following, by adding a `getCounter` function:

  ```solidity
  // SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
  pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

  contract Counter {
      uint256 public number;

      function setNumber(uint256 newNumber) public {
          number = newNumber;
      }

      function increment() public {
          number++;
      }

      function getCount() public view returns (uint256) {
          return number;
      }
  }

    ```

And the test code to the following:

  ```solidity
  // SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
  pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

  import {Test, console} from "forge-std/Test.sol";
  import {Counter} from "../src/Counter.sol";

  contract CounterTest is Test {
      Counter public counter;

      function setUp() public {
          counter = new Counter();
          counter.setNumber(0);
      }

      function test_Increment() public {
          counter.increment();
          assertEq(counter.number(), 1);
      }

      function testFuzz_SetNumber(uint256 x) public {
          counter.setNumber(x);
          assertEq(counter.number(), x);
      }

      function test_GetCount() public {
          uint256 initialCount = counter.getCount();
          counter.increment();
          assertEq(counter.getCount(), initialCount + 1);
      }
  }
    ```

Run the tests with the following command:

  ```bash
  $ forge test
    ```

If tests pass, deploy the contract to the Sei chain with the following command:

  ```bash
  $ forge create --rpc-url $SEI_NODE_URI --mnemonic $MNEMONIC src/Counter.sol:Counter
    ```

Where `$SEI_NODE_URI` is the URI of the Sei node and `$MNEMONIC` is the mnemonic of the account that will deploy the contract. If you run local Sei node, the address will be `http://localhost:8545` , otherwise you could grab a `evm_rpc` url from the [registry](https://github.com/sei-protocol/chain-registry/blob/main/chains.json). If deployment is successful, you will get the EVM contract address in the output.

  ```bash
  [⠒] Compiling...
  No files changed, compilation skipped
  Deployer: $0X_DEPLOYER_ADDRESS
  Deployed to: $0X_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
  Transaction hash: $0X_TX_HASH
    ```

Let's use the `cast` command to query the contract:

  ```bash
  $ cast call $0X_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "getCount()(uint256)" --rpc-url $SEI_NODE_URI
    ```

The command should return `0` as the initial value of the counter.

Now we can use the `cast` command to call the `increment` function:

  ```bash
  $ cast send $0X_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "increment()" --mnemonic $MNEMONIC --rpc-url $SEI_NODE_URI
    ```

If command is successful, you will get the transaction hash and other info back.

Now let's call the `getCount` function again and this case it should return `1`.

## Calling contract from JS client

To call contract from frontend, you could use `ethers` like:

  ```tsx
  import {ethers} from "ethers";

  const privateKey = <Your Private Key>;
  const evmRpcEndpoint = <Your Evm Rpc Endpoint>
  const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(evmRpcEndpoint);
  const signer = new ethers.Wallet(privateKey, provider);

  if (!signer) {
      console.log('No signer found');
      return;
  }
  const abi = [
   {
        "type": "function",
        "name": "setNumber",
        "inputs": [
          {
            "name": "newNumber",
            "type": "uint256",
            "internalType": "uint256"
          }
        ],
        "outputs": [],
        "stateMutability": "nonpayable"
      },
      {
          "type": "function",
          "name": "getCount",
          "inputs": [],
          "outputs": [
              {
                  "name": "",
                  "type": "int256",
                  "internalType": "int256"
              }
          ],
          "stateMutability": "view"
      },
      {
          "type": "function",
          "name": "increment",
          "inputs": [],
          "outputs": [],
          "stateMutability": "nonpayable"
      }
  ];

  // Define the address of the deployed contract
  const contractAddress = 0X_CONTRACT_ADDRESS;

  // Create a new instance of the ethers.js Contract object
  const contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, abi, signer);

  // Call the contract's functions
  async function getCount() {
      const count = await contract.getCount();
      console.log(count.toString());
  }

  async function increment() {
      const txResponse = await contract.increment();
      const mintedTx = await txResponse.wait();
      console.log(mintedTx);
  }

  await increment();
  await getCount();
    ```
