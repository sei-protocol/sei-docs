# Restore a Validator

A validator can be completely restored on a new Sei node with the following set of keys:

- The Consensus key, stored in `~/.sei/config/priv_validator.json`
- The mnemonic to the validator wallet

   <p>Before proceeding, ensure that the existing validator is not active. Double voting has severe slashing consequences.</p>
</Callout>


To restore a validator:

- Setup a full Sei node synced up to the latest block.
- Replace the `~/.sei/config/priv_validator.json` file of the new node with the associated file from the old node, then restart your node.
