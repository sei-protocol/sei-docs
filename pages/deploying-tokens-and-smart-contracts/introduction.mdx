# Introduction

In this section, we'll be going over how to deploy tokens and smart contracts on Sei. More specifically, we'll be deploying a token using the tokenfactory module and an NFT smart contract.

## Token Factory

The `tokenfactory` module provides a standardized mechanism for creating fungible tokens, which are interchangeable and identical. It's an ideal solution for developers looking to deploy standard token types without delving deep into the complexities of smart contract coding.

## Smart Contracts

Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. They are the foundation for creating a wide range of decentralized applications, from simple tokens to complex decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.
