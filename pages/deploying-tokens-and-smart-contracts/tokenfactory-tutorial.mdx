# Token Factory Tutorial

The `tokenfactory` module enables any account to create new tokens with a unique identifier based on the creator's address. Each account can generate multiple tokens by specifying distinct subdenoms. The token creator is granted "admin" privileges, allowing them to mint, burn, and transfer their token.

These tokens are named `factory/{CREATOR_ADDRESS}/{DENOM}` and come with a range of native functionalities.

## Requirements

To create a token on the testnet, ensure you have the following setup:

- The `seid` CLI
- A wallet with SEI tokens on testnet

## Creating a Denom

```bash copy
seid tx tokenfactory create-denom $SUBDENOM --from=$ACCOUNT --chain-id=atlantic-2 --node=https://rpc.atlantic-2.seinetwork.io/ --broadcast-mode=block --fees=20000usei
```

This command creates a new coin with the format `factory/{ACCOUNT}/{SUBDENOM}`. Replace `$SUBDENOM` with your desired denom name and `$ACCOUNT` with your account name. The account specified here will be the token admin.

### Understanding Command Line Arguments

When executing commands in this tutorial, you'll encounter several arguments. Here's a brief overview of what each means:

- `--chain-id=atlantic-2`: This specifies the network where the command will be executed. In this case, `atlantic-2` is the identifier for the Sei testnet.
- `--node=https://rpc.atlantic-2.seinetwork.io/`: This points to the RPC URL of the node you are interacting with.
- `--broadcast-mode=block`: This determines how your transaction is broadcasted to the network. The `block` mode means the transaction will wait to be included in a block before returning a response. This is a safer option as it confirms your transaction is processed.
- `--fees=20000usei`: This is used to specify the transaction fee.

Understanding these arguments will help you execute the commands more confidently and customize them as needed for different scenarios.

## Minting Tokens

```bash copy
seid tx tokenfactory mint $AMOUNT --from=$ACCOUNT --chain-id=atlantic-2 --node=https://rpc.atlantic-2.seinetwork.io/ --broadcast-mode=block --fees=20000usei
```

This command will create (mint) a specific $AMOUNT of your new token. Replace `$AMOUNT` with the number of tokens you want to mint, followed by the token denom generated from the previous command.

To verify that the tokens have been minted, query the balance of your account:

```bash copy
seid query bank balances $ACCOUNT --chain-id=atlantic-2 --node=https://rpc.atlantic-2.seinetwork.io/
```

## Burning Tokens

```bash copy
seid tx tokenfactory burn $AMOUNT --from=$ACCOUNT --chain-id=atlantic-2 --node=https://rpc.atlantic-2.seinetwork.io/ --broadcast-mode=block --fees=20000usei
```

This command allows you to destroy (burn) a specified `$AMOUNT` of your tokens, reducing the total supply. Replace `$AMOUNT` with the quantity you wish to burn.

  Only the token admin has permission to mint and burn tokens. If necessary, you
  can reassign these privileges by using the `change-admin` command to designate
  a new admin.

## Next Steps

🎉 Congrats on completing the Token Factory tutorial! You've learned how to create, mint, and burn tokens on Sei using the `tokenfactory` module.

  Smart contracts can also create TokenFactory denoms and act as token admins,
  allowing for more complex and automated token management strategies.
