# NFT Contract Tutorial

## Introduction

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are unique digital assets with distinct identities and attributes. Unlike fungible tokens from the Token Factory, each NFT is irreplaceable and can't be exchanged on a like-for-like basis.

<Nfts />

This tutorial will guide you through creating and deploying a CW721 NFT contract on Sei, a standard for NFTs in the CosmWasm ecosystem. By the end, you'll have your own NFT contract deployed. Learn more about CW721 [here](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-nfts/blob/main/packages/cw721/README.md).

## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **`seid` CLI**: The Sei command-line interface tool, for interacting with the blockchain.
- **Wallet with SEI tokens on testnet**: Contains SEI tokens for transaction fees.
- **Rust Programming Environment**: Install Rust for CosmWasm contract development. Installation guide [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
- **Understanding of CosmWasm**: Familiarize yourself with CosmWasm smart contracts. Start with the [CosmWasm Book](https://book.cosmwasm.com/).

## Setting Up Your Environment

To work with CosmWasm smart contracts, you'll need the Wasm rust compiler backend installed to build Wasm binaries. To install it, run:

```bash copy
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

Clone the `CW721-base` contract from the [cw-nfts](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-nfts) repository:

```bash copy
git clone https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-nfts.git
cd cw-nfts/contracts/cw721-base
```

To test your setup, run:

```bash copy
cargo test
```

You should see that everything in the repository gets compiled and all tests pass.

## Customizing the Contract

Review and modify the `CW721-base` contract to meet your requirements. This might include updating metadata structures or changing the minting process.

## Build the Contract

To build the contract, run:

```bash copy
cargo wasm
```

This compiles a Wasm binary for uploading to Sei.

  Use the [CosmWasm Rust Optimizer](https://github.com/CosmWasm/rust-optimizer)
  to reduce your contract's size for production deployment. While not required
  for learning, it's recommended for live contracts.
</Callout>

## Deploy the Contract

After building the contract, we'll need to upload the contract to the chain and instantiate it.

Upload your contract:

```bash copy
seid tx wasm store [path to .wasm file] --from=[your-account] --chain-id=[chain-id] --gas-prices=[gas-prices] --gas=[gas-limit] --broadcast-mode=block
```

<Callout emoji="💡">
  Learn about these command line arguments in our CLI reference (TODO: Link to
  CLI docs).
</Callout>

Instantiate your contract using the code ID:

```bash copy
seid tx wasm instantiate [contract-code-id] '{"name":"[NFT Collection Name]", "symbol":"[NFT Symbol]"}' --from=[your-account] --chain-id=[chain-id] --amount=[amount] --label=[label-for-contract] --broadcast-mode=block
```

Successful instantiation will give you the NFT contract address.

## Conclusion

🎉 Congratulations! You've successfully created and deployed a CW721 NFT contract on Sei. Now, explore further customization options, integrate with front-end applications, or engage with the community! (TODO: Add front-end tutorial)
