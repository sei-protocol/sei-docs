# NFT Contract Tutorial

## Introduction

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are unique digital assets, each possessing distinct identities and attributes. Unlike fungible tokens created by the Token Factory, NFTs cannot be exchanged on a like-for-like basis.

<Nfts />

This tutorial guides you through the creation and deployment of an NFT contract on Sei. By the end, you'll have deployed your own NFT contract. Select one of the tabs below to get started!

In this section, we'll use Foundry to deploy an ERC-721 contract to the Ethereum network. ERC-721 is a standard for NFT contracts on Ethereum. Learm more about ERC-721 [here](https://erc721.org/).

## Requirements

Before we start, ensure you have:

- Installed Foundry. Follow the [installation guide](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation).
- A basic understanding of Solidity and smart contract development.
- A wallet with SEI tokens on devnet

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  You can obtain devnet tokens from one of the faucets listed
  [here](/getting-tokens/faucets).
</Callout>

## Setting Up Your Project

1. Initialize a new Foundry project:

   ```bash copy
   forge init my-nft-project
   cd my-nft-project
   ```

2. Install OpenZeppelin, a library for secure smart contract development.

   ```bash copy
   forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts
   ```

3. Create a new Solidity file under `src/` for your NFT contract, e.g., `MyNFT.sol`.

## Writing the ERC-721 Contract

1. In `src/MyNFT.sol`, start by importing OpenZeppelin's ERC-721 implementation:

   ```solidity copy
    // contracts/MyNFT.sol
    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
    pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

    import {ERC721} from "openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";

    contract MyNFT is ERC721 {
        constructor() ERC721("MyNFT", "MNFT") {
        }
    }
   ```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
You may see an error in your IDE about importing `openzeppelin-contracts`. To
resolve this, run this command to create `remapping.txt` in the root of your
project:

```bash copy
forge remappings > remappings.txt
```

</Callout>

2. Add any additional functions or overrides necessary for your NFT.

## Testing Your Contract

1. Write tests for your contract in the `test/` directory.
2. Run your tests with:

   ```bash copy
   forge test
   ```

## Deploying Your Contract

1. Compile your contract:

   ```bash copy
   forge build
   ```

2. Deploy your contract to a local testnet (e.g., using Anvil, Foundry's local Ethereum node):

   ```bash copy
   anvil
   ```

   In a new terminal, deploy your contract:

   ```bash copy
   forge create --rpc-url http://localhost:8545 src/MyNFT.sol:MyNFT
   ```

3. For deploying to the Sei devnet, run `forge create` with the `--rpc-url` and `--private-key` flags.

   ```bash copy
   forge create --rpc-url https://evm-rpc.arctic-1.seinetwork.io/ --private-key <your_private_key> src/MyNFT.sol:MyNFT
   ```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Make sure to have SEI in your account to cover the gas fees for contract
  deployment.
</Callout>

## Interacting With Your NFT

- You can interact with your deployed NFT contract using Foundry's `cast` tool or through other tools like Ethers.js in a script or web application.

In this section, we'll be deploying a CW721 contract, a standard for NFTs in the CosmWasm ecosystem. For more about CW721, visit [here](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-nfts/blob/main/packages/cw721/README.md).

## Requirements

Before starting, ensure you have:

- **`seid` CLI**: The Sei command-line interface tool, for interacting with the blockchain.
- **Wallet with SEI tokens on devnet**: Contains SEI tokens for transaction fees.
- **Rust Programming Environment**: Install Rust for CosmWasm contract development. Installation guide [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
- **Understanding of CosmWasm**: Familiarize yourself with CosmWasm smart contracts. Start with the [CosmWasm Book](https://book.cosmwasm.com/).
- **Docker**: Required for using the CosmWasm Rust Optimizer tool. Install from [Docker's official website](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

## Setting Up Your Environment

To work with CosmWasm smart contracts, you'll need the Wasm rust compiler installed to build Wasm binaries. To install it, run:

```bash copy
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

Next, clone the `CW721-base` contract from the [cw-nfts](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-nfts) repository:

```bash copy
git clone https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-nfts.git
cd cw-nfts/contracts/cw721-base
```

To test your setup, run:

```bash copy
cargo test
```

You should see that everything in the repository gets compiled and all tests pass.

## Customizing the Contract

Review and modify the `cw721-base` contract to meet your requirements. This might include updating metadata structures or changing the minting process.

## Build the Contract

To build the contract, run:

```bash copy
cargo wasm
```

This compiles a Wasm binary for uploading to Sei.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Note: The generated Wasm file will be located in the root directory of the
  `cw-nfts` repository, not in the `cw721-base` subdirectory. Make sure to
  navigate to the root directory to see your compiled `.wasm` file in
  `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/`.
</Callout>

Before we can upload the contract to the chain, we have to use the [CosmWasm Rust Optimizer](https://github.com/CosmWasm/rust-optimizer) to reduce the contract size. While not required, this is highly recommended for live contracts.

```bash copy
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/code \
  --mount type=volume,source="$(basename "$(pwd)")_cache",target=/target \
  --mount type=volume,source=registry_cache,target=/usr/local/cargo/registry \
  cosmwasm/optimizer:0.15.0 ./contracts/cw721-base/
```

This will generate an optimized Wasm contract in `/artifacts`.

## Deploy the Contract

Upload your contract:

```bash copy
seid tx wasm store artifacts/cw721_base.wasm --from=$ACCOUNT --chain-id=arctic-1 --node=https://rpc.arctic-1.seinetwork.io/ --broadcast-mode=block --gas=5000000 --fees=500000usei
```

Replace `$ACCOUNT` with your account name or address. This command stores the contract on the chain and outputs a code ID.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  For detailed descriptions of these arguments, use `seid help` in the CLI.
</Callout>

Instantiate your contract using the code ID:

```bash copy
seid tx wasm instantiate $CONTRACT_CODE_ID '{"name":"$COLLECTION_NAME", "symbol":"$SYMBOL"}' --from=$ACCOUNT --admin=$ADMIN_ADDRESS --label=$LABEL --chain-id=arctic-1 --node=https://rpc.arctic-1.seinetwork.io/ --broadcast-mode=block --gas=250000 --fees=25000usei
```

Replace `$CONTRACT_CODE_ID`, `$ACCOUNT`, `$LABEL`, and `$ADMIN_ADDRESS` appropriately. Successful instantiation will provide the NFT contract address.

- `$CONTRACT_CODE_ID`: code ID of the uploaded contract
- `$COLLECTION_NAME`: Name of the collection
- `$SYMBOL`: Symbol of the collection
- `$ACCOUNT`: your account name or address
- `$LABEL`: any label for easy identification
- `$ADMIN_ADDRESS` (optional): address that will have administrative privileges over the contract, such as the ability to upgrade it
