# NFT Contract Tutorial

## Introduction

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are unique digital assets, each possessing distinct identities and attributes. Unlike fungible tokens created by the Token Factory, NFTs cannot be exchanged on a like-for-like basis.

<Nfts />

This tutorial guides you through the creation and deployment of a CW721 NFT contract on Sei, a standard for NFTs in the CosmWasm ecosystem. By the end, you'll have deployed your own NFT contract. For more about CW721, visit [here](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-nfts/blob/main/packages/cw721/README.md).

## Requirements

Before starting, ensure you have:

- **`seid` CLI**: The Sei command-line interface tool, for interacting with the blockchain.
- **Wallet with SEI tokens on testnet**: Contains SEI tokens for transaction fees.
- **Rust Programming Environment**: Install Rust for CosmWasm contract development. Installation guide [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
- **Understanding of CosmWasm**: Familiarize yourself with CosmWasm smart contracts. Start with the [CosmWasm Book](https://book.cosmwasm.com/).
- **Docker**: Required for using the CosmWasm Rust Optimizer tool. Install from [Docker's official website](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

## Setting Up Your Environment

To work with CosmWasm smart contracts, you'll need the Wasm rust compiler installed to build Wasm binaries. To install it, run:

```bash copy
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

Next, clone the `CW721-base` contract from the [cw-nfts](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-nfts) repository:

```bash copy
git clone https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-nfts.git
cd cw-nfts/contracts/cw721-base
```

To test your setup, run:

```bash copy
cargo test
```

You should see that everything in the repository gets compiled and all tests pass.

## Customizing the Contract

Review and modify the `cw721-base` contract to meet your requirements. This might include updating metadata structures or changing the minting process.

## Build the Contract

To build the contract, run:

```bash copy
cargo wasm
```

This compiles a Wasm binary for uploading to Sei.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Note: The generated Wasm file will be located in the root directory of the
  `cw-nfts` repository, not in the `cw721-base` subdirectory. Make sure to
  navigate to the root directory to see your compiled `.wasm` file in
  `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/`.
</Callout>

Before we can upload the contract to the chain, we have to use the [CosmWasm Rust Optimizer](https://github.com/CosmWasm/rust-optimizer) to reduce the contract size. While not required, this is highly recommended for live contracts.

```bash copy
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/code \
  --mount type=volume,source="$(basename "$(pwd)")_cache",target=/target \
  --mount type=volume,source=registry_cache,target=/usr/local/cargo/registry \
  cosmwasm/optimizer:0.15.0 ./contracts/cw721-base/
```

This will generate an optimized Wasm contract in `/artifacts`.

## Deploy the Contract

Upload your contract:

```bash copy
seid tx wasm store artifacts/cw721_base.wasm --from=$ACCOUNT --chain-id=atlantic-2 --node=https://rpc.atlantic-2.seinetwork.io/ --broadcast-mode=block --gas=5000000 --fees=500000usei
```

Replace `$ACCOUNT` with your account name or address. This command stores the contract on the chain and outputs a code ID.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Learn about these command line arguments in our CLI reference (TODO: Link to
  CLI docs).
</Callout>

Instantiate your contract using the code ID:

```bash copy
seid tx wasm instantiate $CONTRACT_CODE_ID '{"name":"$COLLECTION_NAME", "symbol":"$SYMBOL"}' --from=$ACCOUNT --admin=$ADMIN_ADDRESS --label=$LABEL --chain-id=atlantic-2 --node=https://rpc.atlantic-2.seinetwork.io/ --broadcast-mode=block --gas=250000 --fees=25000usei
```

Replace `$CONTRACT_CODE_ID`, `$ACCOUNT`, `$LABEL`, and `$ADMIN_ADDRESS` appropriately. Successful instantiation will provide the NFT contract address.

- `$CONTRACT_CODE_ID`: code ID of the uploaded contract
- `$COLLECTION_NAME`: Name of the collection
- `$SYMBOL`: Symbol of the collection
- `$ACCOUNT`: your account name or address
- `$LABEL`: any label for easy identification
- `$ADMIN_ADDRESS` (optional): address that will have administrative privileges over the contract, such as the ability to upgrade it

## Conclusion

🎉 Congratulations! You've successfully created and deployed a CW721 NFT contract on Sei.
