# NFT Contract Tutorial

## Introduction

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are unique digital assets, each with its identity and attributes. Unlike fungible assets like tokens created from Token Factory, NFTs cannot be exchanged on a like-for-like basis, ensuring that each one remains distinct and irreplaceable.

This tutorial guides you through the process of creating and deploying a CW721 NFT contract on Sei. [CW721](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-nfts/blob/main/packages/cw721/README.md) is a standard for non-fungible tokens on CosmWasm, similar to ERC721 on Ethereum. By the end of this tutorial, you will have deployed your own NFT contract.

## Requirements

Before starting, please ensure you have the following setup:

- **`seid` CLI**: Install and configure the Sei CLI tool. This is essential for interacting with the Sei blockchain.
- **Wallet with SEI tokens on testnet**: Have access to a wallet on the Sei testnet containing SEI tokens. These tokens are necessary to pay for transaction fees during the contract deployment process.
- **Rust programming environment**: Install Rust, the programming language used for developing CosmWasm contracts. You can find the installation guide [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
- **Familiarity with CosmWasm**: A basic understanding of CosmWasm smart contracts will be beneficial. For those new to CosmWasm, we recommend going through the [CosmWasm Book](https://book.cosmwasm.com/).

## Setting Up Your Environment

To work with CosmWasm smart contracts, you'll need the Wasm rust compiler backend installed to build Wasm binaries. To install it, run:

```bash copy
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

Next, we'll be using the `CW721-base` contract, so checkout the [cw-nfts](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-nfts) repository:

```bash copy
git clone https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-nfts.git
cd cw-nfts/contracts/cw721-base
```

To check if you have successfully set up the contract, run the testing command in this folder:

```bash copy
cargo test
```

You should see that everything in the repository gets compiled, and all tests pass.

## Customizing the Contract

## Build & Deploy Contract

To buld the contract, run the following command:

```bash copy
cargo wasm
```
