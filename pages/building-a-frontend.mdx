# Building a Frontend

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll go over how to:

- Set up your frontend project
- Connect to a Sei wallet
- Query and interact with a smart contract

## Requirements

Before starting, ensure you have:

- Node.js & NPM
- A Sei wallet extension
  - [Compass](https://compasswallet.io/)
  - [Fin](https://finwallet.com/)

## Creating a React Project

If you're creating a project from scratch, we recommend using the typescript template from Vite, which makes development and debugging much easier.

```bash copy
npm create vite@latest my-counter-frontend -- --template react-ts
```

This will create a new folder with a React project that uses typescript. Open `my-counter-frontend` in your favorite IDE.

## Installing Dependencies

From a terminal at the root of this project install the required project dependencies: `@sei-js/core` and `@sei-js/react`.

```bash copy
npm install @sei-js/core @sei-js/react
```

## Wrap App in SeiWalletProvider

## Add Home Component

## Run Application
