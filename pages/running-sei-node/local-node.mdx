# Local Sei Node
In this guide, we'll walk you through how to set up the Sei blockchain locally on your machine.

## Prerequisites
To begin, ensure you are in the sei-chain repository on your local machine.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sei-protocol/sei-chain
cd sei-chain
```

### Running a Local Single-node Testnet
To run Sei locally, run the following command
```bash
./scripts/initialize_local_chain.sh
```

Once you run the initialization script, the seid process will be running 1 node locally. It will also seed 50 accounts. 
To verify the status of the local blockchain, open a new tab and run
```bash
seid status | jq
```

If the chain is running properly, you should see output similar to the following:
```json

```

To deploy multiple nodes, you can use a docker container to start a sei chain cluster.

### Install Docker & Docker Compose
#### For MacOS:

The easiest and recommended way to get Docker and Docker Compose is to install Docker Desktop here:

https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/


#### For Ubuntu:

Follow the link below to install docker on ubuntu

https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository

Follow the link below to install standalone docker compose

https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/other/

## Deploy Sei Chain Validators on Docker
Detailed instructions and commands can be found in the [Makefile](https://github.com/sei-protocol/sei-chain/blob/main/Makefile) of the sei-chain repo.

### Start a 4 Node Validator Cluster
This will start a 4 node sei chain cluster,  each validator node will be running in its own docker container, and each node will also run the oracle price feeder daemon

```bash
# If this is the first time or you want to rebuild the binary:
make docker-cluster-start

# If you have run docker-cluster-start and build/seid exist, 
# you can skip the build process to quick start by:
make docker-cluster-start-skipbuild
```

All the logs and genesis files will be generated under the temporary build/generated folder. To access the service log:

```bash
# Monitor logs after cluster is started for node0
tail -f build/generated/seid-0.log
```

### SSH into a single validator node
```bash
# List all containers
docker ps -a
# SSH into a running container
docker exec -it [container_name] /bin/bash
```

## Deploy a State Sync Node

**Requirement**:  Follow the above steps to start a 4 node docker cluster before starting any state sync node.
```bash
# Be sure to start up a 4-node cluster before you start a state sync node
make docker-cluster-start
# Wait for at least a few minutes till the latest block height exceed 500 (this can be changed via app.toml)
seid status |jq
# Start up a state sync node
make run-rpc-nodesh
```

## Local Docker for Debugging and Testing
One of the fanciest thing of using docker is fast iteration. Here we support:
- Being able to make changes locally and start up the chain to see the immediate impact
- Being able to make changes to local dependency repo (Cosmo SDK/Tendermint) and start the chain with the latest changes without bumping or release any binary version
In order to make local debugging work, you can follow these steps:
```bash
# Clone your dependency repo and put them under the same path as sei-chain
cd sei-chain
cd ../
git clone https://github.com/sei-protocol/sei-tendermint.git
git clone https://github.com/sei-protocol/sei-cosmos.git

# Modify go.mod file to point to local repo, must use the exact same path as below:
cd sei-chain
go mod edit -replace github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk=../sei-cosmos
go mod edit -replace github.com/tendermint/tendermint=../sei-tendermint

# Start the docker cluster
make docker-cluster-start
# You are good to go now! Make changes as you wish to any of the dependency repo and run docker to test it out.
```
