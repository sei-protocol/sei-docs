# Pointer Contracts

## Overview

Pointer Contracts are a unique feature introduced in Sei, designed to enhance interoperability between EVM and CosmWasm environments. These contracts facilitate the creation of 'pointer' tokens that establish links between tokens across both EVM and CosmWasm. This enables tokens to move smoothly and be used seamlessly in both environments.

## Deploying a Pointer Contract

This section guides you through the process of deploying a Pointer Contract using the Seid CLI.

### Prerequisites

To deploy a Pointer Contract on devnet, you'll need the following setup:

- Ensure you have the Sei CLI installed on your machine. If not, you can install it by following the [installation guide](/quickstart/installing-seid.mdx).
- Have your CW20 or ERC20 token details handy, as you'll need them to create the corresponding pointer token.

### Deploying an ERC20 Pointer Contract

#### For Native Tokens

To deploy an ERC20 Pointer Contract that links to a tokenfactory or IBC token, you can use the following command:

```bash copy
seid tx evm deploy-erc20 $DENOM $NAME $SYMBOL $DECIMAL --from=$SENDER --evm-rpc=https://evm-rpc.arctic-1.seinetwork.io/
```

**Parameters**

- `DENOM`: The denom of the token you want to create an ERC20 pointer for.
- `NAME`: The name you want to assign to your ERC20 pointer token. This should match the name of the native token denom.
- `SYMBOL`: The symbol for your ERC20 pointer token. This should match the symbol of the native token denom.

**Flags**

- `--from`: The Sei address from which the deployment transaction is sent. This address must have enough balance to cover transaction fees.
- `--evm-rpc`: The endpoint URL for the EVM RPC interface of the Sei blockchain. This URL is used by the seid command to interact with the Sei EVM.

<Callout type="info">
  To learn more about the various command line arguments and flags, use the
  `--help` flag for any CLI commands. For example:

    ```bash copy
    seid tx evm --help
    ```

</Callout>

#### For CW20 Tokens

To deploy an ERC20 Pointer Contract that links to a CW20 token, you can use the following command:

```bash copy
seid tx evm deploy-erccw20 $CW20_TOKEN_ADDRESS $NAME $SYMBOL --from=$SENDER --evm-rpc=https://evm-rpc.arctic-1.seinetwork.io/
```

**Parameters**

- `CW20_TOKEN_ADDRESS`: The contract address of the CW20 token you want to create an ERC20 pointer for.
- `NAME`: The name you want to assign to your ERC20 pointer token. This should match the name from the CW20 token.
- `SYMBOL`: The symbol for your ERC20 pointer token. This should match the symbol from the CW20 token.

**Flags**

- `--from`: The Sei address from which the deployment transaction is sent. This address must have enough balance to cover transaction fees.
- `--evm-rpc`: The endpoint URL for the EVM RPC interface of the Sei blockchain. This URL is used by the seid command to interact with the Sei EVM.

#### For CW721 Tokens

To deploy an ERC721 Pointer Contract that links to a CW721 NFT contract, you can use the following command:

```bash copy
seid tx evm deploy-erccw721 $CW721_TOKEN_ADDRESS $NAME $SYMBOL --from=$SENDER --evm-rpc=https://evm-rpc.arctic-1.seinetwork.io/
```

**Parameters**

- `CW721_TOKEN_ADDRESS`: The contract address of the CW721 NFT you want to create an ERC721 pointer for.
- `NAME`: The name you want to assign to your ERC721 pointer token. This should match the name from the CW721 NFT.
- `SYMBOL`: The symbol for your ERC721 pointer token. This should match the symbol from the CW721 NFT.

**Flags**

- `--from`: The Sei address from which the deployment transaction is sent. This address must have enough balance to cover transaction fees.
- `--evm-rpc`: The endpoint URL for the EVM RPC interface of the Sei blockchain. This URL is used by the seid command to interact with the Sei EVM.
