# CosmWasm Precompile

**Address**: `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001002`

This precompile serves as an interface to the CosmWasm module, enabling EVM based clients and smart contracts to interact with CosmWasm contracts directly.

## Functions

### Transactions
- `instantiate`: Instantiates a new CosmWasm contract

**Payable**: Any Sei amounts used to instantiate must be sent to the contract directly. Use the `coins` field for other params. 

  ```solidity
  /// Instantiates a new CosmWasm contract.
  /// @param codeID The codeID of the contract.
  /// @param admin The Sei address of the account to be set as contract admin.
  /// @param msg The msg to send for instantiation. The format is specified by the contract code.
  /// @param label Any labels to include for the new contract.
  /// @param coins Any non-sei denominations that the contract requires for instantiation.
  /// @return The contract address and associated data.
  function instantiate(
      uint64 codeID,
      string memory admin,
      bytes memory msg,
      string memory label,
      bytes memory coins
  ) payable external returns (string memory contractAddr, bytes memory data);
  ```

- `execute`: Sends a message to a CosmWasm contract for execution

**Payable**: Any Sei amounts required for contract execution must be sent to the contract directly. Use the `coins` field for other params. 

  ```solidity
  /// Executes some message on a CosmWasm contract.
  /// @param contractAddress The Sei address of the contract to execute.
  /// @param msg The msg to send for execution. The format is specified by the contract code.
  /// @param coins Any non-sei denominations that the contract requires for execution.
  /// @return The execution response from the CosmWasm contract.
  function execute(
      string memory contractAddress,
      bytes memory msg,
      bytes memory coins
  ) payable external returns (bytes memory response);
  ```

### Queries
- `query`: Queries a CosmWasm contract state
  ```solidity
  /// Queries a CosmWasm contract.
  /// @param contractAddress The Sei address of the contract to query.
  /// @param req The query requeest object. The format is specified by the contract code.
  /// @return The response from the CosmWasm contract.
  function query(
      string memory contractAddress,
      bytes memory req
  ) external view returns (bytes memory response)
  ```
