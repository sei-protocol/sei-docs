# Staking

## What is Staking and Why Stake?
Staking is the process of participating in network operations by holding and "locking" a certain amount of sei to
receive rewards. Token holders can delegate their staksei to a validator, thus helping with the block validation
process.Staking is a crucial element that contributes to network security and efficiency.

Stakers earn rewards in the form of transaction fees and newly minted tokens proportional to the amount of tokens
staked.

However, there are some risks and considerations to staking:
- **Lock-up Periods:** Staked sei is locked up for 21 days in which they cannot be moved. This can be a risk if the
token price fluctuates significantly during this time

- **Slashing:** Validators are punished for malicious activities or incompetence (like being offline). This is known as
slashing where a portion of the staked tokens are lost.

## How to Stake
Once you are read to stake, head over to the [Sei app staking page](https://app.sei.io/stake?tab=allValidators),
pick a validator and stake. Remember the risks and considerations above.
