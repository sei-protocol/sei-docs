# Interact with EVM on Sei via CLI
You can query or send transactions to Sei easily via CLI once you have the `seid` command installed (see `Installing Seid`)

## Queries
If the machine you run these commands aren't a node of the network, you'd need to append `--node http://url-to-sei-cosmos-rpc` to your command.

- `seid q evm sei-addr [some EVM address]`: gets the associated Sei address, if exists on-chain, of the queried EVM address
- `seid q evm evm-addr [some Sei address]`: gets the associated EVM address, if exists on-chain, of the queried Sei address
- `seid q evm erc20 [erc20 address] [method] [arguments...]`: query the ERC20 contract at given address for the given method/arguments
- `seid q evm payload [abi-filepath] [method] [arguments...]`: generate the hexadecimal payload of the requested method call given an ABI
- `seid q evm pointer [type] [pointee]`: gets the pointer contract of the requested pointee. `type` can be one of "NATIVE", "CW20", "CW721", "ERC20", or "ERC721", and `pointee` is the target contract address (except for "NATIVE" type, for which `pointee` would be the native denom name)

## Transactions
Sending transactions via CLI requires you to have keys added via `seid keys add`. You can then specify the key you want to use by appending `--from=[key name]` to your command.

If the machine you run these commands aren't a node of the network, you'd need to append `--evm-rpc http://url-to-sei-evm-rpc` to your command.

- `seid tx evm associate-address`: associate Sei address and EVM address on-chain for the sending key
- `seid tx evm send [to EVM address] [amount in wei]`: send native tokens to the target EVM address
- `seid tx evm deploy [path to binary]`: deploy an EVM contract
- `seid tx evm call-contract [addr] [payload hex]`: send a transaction that calls contract at the target address with the provided payload
- `seid tx evm erc20-send [addr] [recipient] [amount]`: send ERC20 tokens of contract at `addr` to the target recipient
- `seid tx evm delegate [val-addr] [amount]`: delegate specified amount to the target validator address. Note that the validator address would be in Sei/Cosmos validator address format
