# Interact with EVM on Sei via CLI
You can query or send transactions to Sei easily via CLI once you have the `seid` command installed (see [Installing Seid](./installing-seid))

## Queries
If the machine you run these commands from are not running a node of the network, you'll need to append `--node http://url-to-sei-cosmos-rpc` to your command. Refer to the [Tools and Resources](/tools-and-resources) page for a list of RPC endpoints.

- `seid q evm sei-addr [some EVM address]`: Gets the associated Sei address of the queried EVM address, if it exists on-chain.
- `seid q evm evm-addr [some Sei address]`: Gets the associated EVM address of the queried Sei address, if it exists on-chain. 
- `seid q evm erc20 [erc20 address] [method] [arguments...]`: Query the ERC20 contract at given address using the given method/arguments.
- `seid q evm payload [abi-filepath] [method] [arguments...]`: Generate the hexadecimal payload of the requested method call given an ABI.
- `seid q evm pointer [type] [pointee]`: Gets the pointer contract of the requested pointee. The `type` parameter can be one of "NATIVE", "CW20", "CW721", "ERC20", or "ERC721", and `pointee` is the target contract address.
For "NATIVE" type, `pointee` would be the native denom name instead.

## Transactions
Sending transactions via CLI requires you to have keys added via `seid keys add`. You can then specify the key you want to use by appending `--from=[key name]` to your command.

If the machine you run these commands from are not a node of the network, you'd need to append `--evm-rpc http://url-to-sei-evm-rpc` to your command. Refer to the [Tools and Resources](/tools-and-resources) page for a list of RPC endpoints.

- `seid tx evm associate-address`: Associates the Sei address and EVM address on-chain for the sending key.
- `seid tx evm send [to EVM address] [amount in wei]`: Sends native tokens to the target EVM address.
- `seid tx evm deploy [path_to_binary]`: Deploys the EVM contract specified in `path_to_binary`.
- `seid tx evm call-contract [addr] [payload hex]`: Sends a transaction that calls contract at the target address with the provided payload.
- `seid tx evm erc20-send [addr] [recipient] [amount]`: Sends ERC20 tokens of contract at `addr` to the target recipient.
- `seid tx evm delegate [val-addr] [amount]`: Delegates specified amount to the target validator address. The validator address must be in Sei/Cosmos validator address format.
