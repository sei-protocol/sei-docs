# Building a Frontend

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll demonstrate how to set up a frontend project using React. You'll learn how to connect to a Sei wallet and interact with CosmWasm smart contracts deployed on Sei.

In this section, we'll use the [@sei-js](https://github.com/sei-protocol/sei-js/) library to build a React app that interacts with a CosmWasm contract.

## Requirements

Before starting, ensure you have:

- Node.js & NPM installed
- A Sei wallet extension, such as:
  - [Compass](https://compasswallet.io/)
  - [Fin](https://finwallet.com/)

## Creating a React Project

If you're starting a project from scratch, we recommend using the TypeScript template from Vite for easier development and debugging.

```bash copy
npm create vite@latest my-counter-frontend -- --template react-ts
```

This command creates a new folder with a React project using TypeScript. Open `my-counter-frontend` in your favorite IDE.

<Callout type="info">
  The rest of this tutorial will be in TypeScript. If you're not using
  TypeScript, you can easily adjust by removing the types.
</Callout>

## Installing Dependencies

From the terminal at the root of your project, install the required dependencies: `@sei-js/core` and `@sei-js/react`.

```bash copy
npm install @sei-js/core @sei-js/react
```

<Callout type="info">
  `@sei-js` contains NPM libraries for writing applications that interact with
  Sei. Learn more [here](https://github.com/sei-protocol/sei-js/tree/main).

## Wrapping App in SeiWalletProvider

Replace the code in your `App.tsx` file with the following to set up a `SeiWalletProvider` context, define your chain info, and set connection URLs.

```tsx copy
import { SeiWalletProvider } from "@sei-js/react";
import "./App.css";
import Home from "./Home.tsx";

function App() {
  return (
    // Set up SeiWalletProvider for easy wallet connection and to use hooks in @sei-js/react
    <SeiWalletProvider
      chainConfiguration={{
        chainId: "atlantic-2",
        restUrl: "https://rest.atlantic-2.seinetwork.io",
        rpcUrl: "https://rpc.atlantic-2.seinetwork.io",
      }}
      wallets={["compass", "fin"]}
    >
      <Home />
    </SeiWalletProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Detailed outline of `App.tsx`

**Wallet Provider Setup**

- Imports `SeiWalletProvider` from the `@sei-js/react` package.
- Wraps `App` with `SeiWalletProvider` for wallet context.

**Chain Configuration**

- Specifies the `chainConfiguration` prop in `SeiWalletProvider` to set up the blockchain network:
  - `chainId`: Identifies the Sei network (in this case, `atlantic-2`).
  - `restUrl`: REST URL for the Sei (You may need your own provider).
  - `rpcUrl`: RPC URL for the Sei (You may need your own provider).

**Supported Wallets**

- Sets up supported wallet types (`'compass'`, `'fin'`, `'leap'`, `'keplr'`) in the wallets prop.

## Adding Home Component

Create a file named `Home.tsx` in your `src` directory with the following code:

```tsx copy
import { useCallback, useEffect, useState } from "react";
import {
  useCosmWasmClient,
  useSigningCosmWasmClient,
  useWallet,
  WalletConnectButton,
} from "@sei-js/react";

// atlantic-2 example contract
const CONTRACT_ADDRESS =
  "sei1kaq032fm8nz9ct58c8s7chgds5zz68pvy4npwx3r9a0kq9ygw0sscuas7c";

function Home() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState<number | undefined>();
  const [error, setError] = useState<string>("");
  const [isIncrementing, setIsIncrementing] = useState<boolean>(false);

  // Helpful hook for getting the currently connected wallet and chain info
  const { connectedWallet, accounts } = useWallet();

  // For querying cosmwasm smart contracts
  const { cosmWasmClient: queryClient } = useCosmWasmClient();

  // For executing messages on cosmwasm smart contracts
  const { signingCosmWasmClient: signingClient } = useSigningCosmWasmClient();

  const fetchCount = useCallback(async () => {
    const response = await queryClient?.queryContractSmart(CONTRACT_ADDRESS, {
      get_count: {},
    });
    return response?.count;
  }, [queryClient]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchCount().then(setCount);
  }, [connectedWallet, fetchCount]);

  const incrementCounter = async () => {
    setIsIncrementing(true);
    try {
      const senderAddress = accounts[0].address;

      // Build message content
      const msg = { increment: {} };

      // Define gas price and limit
      const fee = {
        amount: [{ amount: "20000", denom: "usei" }],
        gas: "200000",
      };

      // Call smart contract execute msg
      await signingClient?.execute(senderAddress, CONTRACT_ADDRESS, msg, fee);

      // Updates the counter state again
      const updatedCount = await fetchCount();
      setCount(updatedCount);

      setIsIncrementing(false);
      setError("");
    } catch (error) {
      if (error instanceof Error) {
        setError(error.message);
      } else {
        setError("unknown error");
      }
      setIsIncrementing(false);
    }
  };

  // Helpful component for wallet connection
  if (!connectedWallet) return <WalletConnectButton />;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Count is: {count ? count : "---"}</h1>
      <button disabled={isIncrementing} onClick={incrementCounter}>
        {isIncrementing ? "incrementing..." : "increment"}
      </button>
      {error && <p style={{ color: "red" }}>{error}</p>}
    </div>
  );
}

export default Home;
```

We deployed a counter contract on the `atlantic-2` testnet. Contract address: `sei1kaq032fm8nz9ct58c8s7chgds5zz68pvy4npwx3r9a0kq9ygw0sscuas7c`. Learn more about this contract [here](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-template).

### Detailed outline of `Home.tsx`

**Render Logic**

- Shows `WalletConnectButton` if no wallet is connected.
- Otherwise, displays the counter value and an "Increment" button.
- Disables the button when a transaction is pending.
- Catches and displays error messages, if any.

**Wallet and Client Setup**

- Utilizes `useWallet` hook from `@sei-js/react` to get the connected wallet and accounts.
- Uses `useCosmWasmClient` and `useSigningCosmWasmClient` hooks from `@sei-js/react` to instantiate `queryClient` and `signingClient`. The signing client can be used for querying, but it is not recommended to use a signing client when only a query client is needed.

**Fetching Counter Value**

- `fetchCount` function uses `queryClient.queryContractSmart` to query the smart contract with the query `{ get_count: {} }`.

**Incrementing Counter**

- `incrementCounter` function:
  - Extracts `senderAddress` from the connected wallet's accounts.
  - Builds a message with `{ increment: {} }` to be sent to the smart contract.
  - Specifies the transaction fee with gas price and gas limit.
  - Calls `signingClient.execute` to execute the contract with the built message and fee.

By leveraging `@sei-js` and its hooks, the component provides a way to connect to a wallet, query a CosmWasm smart contract to get the current counter state, and increment it with an execute message.

## Running the App

Run `npm run dev` and navigate to http://localhost:5173/ to view your application.

<Callout type="info">
  If this is your first time using Sei, you might see an error which says your
  account does not exist on chain. You can claim some testnet tokens for
  development purposes from a faucet [here](/getting-tokens/faucets).
</Callout>
