# Token Factory Tutorial

The `tokenfactory` module enables any account to create new tokens with a unique identifier based on the creator's address. Each account can generate multiple tokens by specifying distinct denoms. The token creator is granted "admin" privileges, allowing them to mint, burn, and transfer their token.

These tokens are named `factory/{CREATOR_ADDRESS}/{DENOM}` and come with a range of native functionalities.

## Requirements

To create a token on the devnet, ensure you have the following setup:

- The `seid` CLI
- A wallet with SEI tokens on devnet

<Callout type="info">
  You can obtain devnet tokens from one of the faucets listed
  [here](/getting-tokens/faucets).
</Callout>
<Callout type="warning">
    If you are coming from EVM/Metamask, you may need to import your private key to keychain using `seid keys add` command.
    To export key from Metamask, follow the instructions [here](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-export-an-account-s-private-key).
    Also have your seed phrase ready to recover your account rather than re-creating it.
    Now add private key to the keychain with the following command:
    ```bash
    seid keys add $PRIVATE_KEY --recover --coin-type 60
    ```
    Replace `$PRIVATE_KEY` with your private key.

</Callout>

## Creating a Denom

```bash copy
seid tx tokenfactory create-denom $DENOM --from=$ACCOUNT --chain-id=arctic-1 --node=https://rpc.arctic-1.seinetwork.io/ --broadcast-mode=block --fees=20000usei
```

This command creates a new coin with the format `factory/{ACCOUNT}/{DENOM}`. Replace `$DENOM` with your desired denom name and `$ACCOUNT` with your account name. The account specified here will be the token admin.

<Callout>
Simplify your tutorial experience by setting the `$DENOM` and `$ACCOUNT` variables in your terminal. This allows you to easily refer to these variables throughout the tutorial.

For instance, to set a denom called `solid` and use the account name of your choice, use the following commands:

```bash code
DENOM=solid
ACCOUNT=your_account_name
```

Replace `your_account_name` with the actual name of your account. Once set, you can refer to these values throughout the session using `$DENOM` and `$ACCOUNT`.

</Callout>

### Understanding Command Line Arguments

When executing commands in this tutorial, you'll encounter several arguments. Here's a brief overview of what each means:

- `--chain-id=arctic-1`: This specifies the network where the command will be executed. In this case, `arctic-1` is the identifier for the Sei devnet.
- `--node=https://rpc.arctic-1.seinetwork.io/`: This points to the RPC URL of the node you are interacting with.
- `--broadcast-mode=block`: This determines how your transaction is broadcasted to the network. The `block` mode means the transaction will wait to be included in a block before returning a response. This is a safer option as it confirms your transaction is processed.
- `--fees=20000usei`: This is used to specify the transaction fee.

Understanding these arguments will help you execute the commands more confidently and customize them as needed for different scenarios.

<Callout type="info">
  For detailed descriptions of these arguments, use `seid help` in the CLI.

## Minting Tokens

```bash copy
seid tx tokenfactory mint $AMOUNT --from=$ACCOUNT --chain-id=arctic-1 --node=https://rpc.arctic-1.seinetwork.io/ --broadcast-mode=block --fees=20000usei
```

This command will create (mint) a specific `$AMOUNT` of your new token. Replace `$AMOUNT` with the number of tokens you want to mint, followed by the token denom generated from the previous command.
<Callout>
For instance, if you would like to mint 1M tokens, you should input `1000000factory/{ACCOUNT}/{DENOM}` as amount.
Or you could set a new variable for the amount:
```bash
AMOUNT=1000000factory/${ACCOUNT}/${DENOM}
```
</Callout>

To verify that the tokens have been minted, query the balance of your account:

```bash copy
seid query bank balances $ACCOUNT --chain-id=arctic-1 --node=https://rpc.arctic-1.seinetwork.io/
```

## Burning Tokens

```bash copy
seid tx tokenfactory burn $AMOUNT --from=$ACCOUNT --chain-id=arctic-1 --node=https://rpc.arctic-1.seinetwork.io/ --broadcast-mode=block --fees=20000usei
```

This command allows you to burn a specific amount of your tokens, reducing the total supply. To use it, replace `$AMOUNT` with the number of tokens you wish to destroy.
<Callout>
For instance, to burn 100 tokens, you should input `100factory/{ACCOUNT}/{DENOM}`. Ensure that you substitute `{ACCOUNT}` and `{DENOM}` with your actual account address and token denomination, respectively.
Or update the variable:
```bash
AMOUNT=100factory/${ACCOUNT}/${DENOM}
```
</Callout>
<Callout type="info">
  Only the token admin has permission to mint and burn tokens. If necessary, you
  can reassign these privileges by using the `change-admin` command to designate
  a new admin.
</Callout>

## Next Steps

ðŸŽ‰ Congrats on completing the Token Factory tutorial! You've learned how to create, mint, and burn tokens on Sei using the `tokenfactory` module.

<Callout>
  Smart contracts can also create TokenFactory denoms and act as token admins,
  allowing for more complex and automated token management strategies.
