# Token Standards

There are numerous token standards across various blockchains. These standards help ensure smart contracts remain
composable, so for instance when a new project issues a token, that it remains compatible with existing decentralized
exchanges.

## Sei Token Standards

Here are some of the most popular token standards on Sei:

- **ERC20**: A standard for fungible tokens on Ethereum, allowing for the creation of interchangeable tokens used for digital currencies, voting rights, or as staking tokens.
- **ERC721**: Defines a standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Ethereum, each representing a unique asset or item. Widely used for digital collectibles and artwork, allowing for the verification of ownership and uniqueness.

- **TokenFactory**: This offers a standardized mechanism for creating fungible tokens, which are interchangeable and
  identical. These tokens can embody various digital assets like voting rights, virtual currencies, or staking tokens.
  They are also native sdk.Coins and come with a variety of native functionality
- **CW721**: This contract provides a standard approach for handling non-fungible tokens (NFTs). These are unique and are
  not interchangeable with any other token. Examples could include ownership rights to a piece of artwork, or the
  licensing for a specific song.
- **CW20**: Although not recommended, this contract provides another approach for handling fungible tokens.
  Similar to ERC-20 standard, contracts can implement this specification. CW20 contracts provide a standardized framework
  for the issuance, transfer, and tracking of fungible tokens.

TokenFactory is **strongly recommended** over CW20 for several reasons including:

- performance since less gas is required to interact with it
- security since it shares the same security model as the base blockchain
- standardization since it directly integrates with the native bank module
