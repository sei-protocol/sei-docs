# EVM \<\> Wasm Interoperability

Sei has introduced features to bridge the gap between EVM and Wasm, allowing for smooth and easy interactions between both environments.

## Precompiled Contracts

Sei precompiles are smart contracts embedded directly within the Sei blockchain. They provide a gateway for users and developers to access native Sei functionalities through the EVM RPC interface.

### Sei Precompiles

The following is a list of precompiled contracts available on Sei:

- [CosmWasm](./precompiles/cosmwasm.mdx)
- [Staking](./precompiles/staking.mdx)
- [Governance](./precompiles/governance.mdx)

For instructions on utilizing these precompiles, refer to the [Example Usage](./precompiles/example-usage.mdx) section.

## Pointer Contracts

Pointer Contracts are a unique feature introduced on Sei, designed to enhance interoperability between EVM and CosmWasm environments. These contracts facilitate the creation of "pointer" tokens that establish links between tokens across both EVM and CosmWasm. This enables tokens to move smoothly and be used seamlessly in both environments.
