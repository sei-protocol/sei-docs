# Pointer Contracts

## Deploying a Pointer Contract

This section guides you through the process of deploying a Pointer Contract for various Sei token standards using the Seid CLI.

<Callout type="info">
  For an in-depth understanding of Sei token standards, click
  [here](/token-standards).
</Callout>

### Prerequisites

To deploy a Pointer Contract on devnet, you'll need the following setup:

- Ensure you have the Sei CLI installed on your machine. If not, you can install it by following the [installation guide](/quickstart/installing-seid.mdx).
- Have your CW20 or ERC20 token details handy, as you'll need them to create the corresponding pointer token.

### Deploying an EVM Pointer Contract

#### For Native Tokens

To deploy an ERC20 Pointer Contract that links to a tokenfactory or IBC token, you can use the following command:

```bash copy
seid tx evm deploy-erc20 $DENOM $NAME $SYMBOL $DECIMAL --from=$SENDER --evm-rpc=https://evm-rpc.arctic-1.seinetwork.io/
```

**Parameters**

- `DENOM`: The denom of the token you want to create an ERC20 pointer for.
- `NAME`: The name you want to assign to your ERC20 pointer token. This should match the name of the native token denom.
- `SYMBOL`: The symbol for your ERC20 pointer token. This should match the symbol of the native token denom.

**Flags**

- `--from`: The Sei address from which the deployment transaction is sent. This address must have enough balance to cover transaction fees.
- `--evm-rpc`: The endpoint URL for the EVM RPC interface of the Sei blockchain. This URL is used by the seid command to interact with the Sei EVM.

<Callout type="info">
  To learn more about the various command line arguments and flags, use the
  `--help` flag for any CLI commands. For example:

    ```bash copy
    seid tx evm --help
    ```

</Callout>

#### For CW20 Tokens

To deploy an ERC20 Pointer Contract that links to a CW20 token, you can use the following command:

```bash copy
seid tx evm deploy-erccw20 $CW20_TOKEN_ADDRESS $NAME $SYMBOL --from=$SENDER --evm-rpc=https://evm-rpc.arctic-1.seinetwork.io/
```

**Parameters**

- `CW20_TOKEN_ADDRESS`: The contract address of the CW20 token you want to create an ERC20 pointer for.
- `NAME`: The name you want to assign to your ERC20 pointer token. This should match the name from the CW20 token.
- `SYMBOL`: The symbol for your ERC20 pointer token. This should match the symbol from the CW20 token.

**Flags**

- `--from`: The Sei address from which the deployment transaction is sent. This address must have enough balance to cover transaction fees.
- `--evm-rpc`: The endpoint URL for the EVM RPC interface of the Sei blockchain. This URL is used by the seid command to interact with the Sei EVM.

#### For CW721 Tokens

To deploy an ERC721 Pointer Contract that links to a CW721 NFT contract, you can use the following command:

```bash copy
seid tx evm deploy-erccw721 $CW721_TOKEN_ADDRESS $NAME $SYMBOL --from=$SENDER --evm-rpc=https://evm-rpc.arctic-1.seinetwork.io/
```

**Parameters**

- `CW721_TOKEN_ADDRESS`: The contract address of the CW721 NFT you want to create an ERC721 pointer for.
- `NAME`: The name you want to assign to your ERC721 pointer token. This should match the name from the CW721 NFT.
- `SYMBOL`: The symbol for your ERC721 pointer token. This should match the symbol from the CW721 NFT.

**Flags**

- `--from`: The Sei address from which the deployment transaction is sent. This address must have enough balance to cover transaction fees.
- `--evm-rpc`: The endpoint URL for the EVM RPC interface of the Sei blockchain. This URL is used by the seid command to interact with the Sei EVM.

### Deploying a CW Pointer Contract

#### For ERC20 Tokens

To deploy an CW20 Pointer Contract that links to a ERC20 token, you can use the following command:

```bash copy
seid tx wasm instantiate 7 '{"erc20_address": "$ERC20_TOKEN_ADDRESS"}' --from=$SENDER --label=$LABEL --chain-id=arctic-1 --broadcast-mode=block --gas=250000 --fees=25000usei --node=https://rpc-arctic-1.sei-apis.com/ --no-admin
```

**Parameters**

- `ERC20_TOKEN_ADDRESS`: The contract address of the ERC20 token you want to create an CW20 pointer for.

**Flags**

- `--from`: The Sei address from which the deployment transaction is sent. This address must have enough balance to cover transaction fees.
- `--label`: A name for the contract instance used to identify the contract.
- `--chain-id`: Identifies the specific chain of the Sei network you're interacting with. `arctic-1` refers to the Sei devnet.
- `--broadcast-mode`: Determines how the transaction is broadcasted. Setting this to `block` means the transaction will wait to be included in a block before returning a response.
- `--gas`: Specifies the maximum amount of gas that can be consumed by the transaction.
- `--fees`: Indicates the transaction fee.
- `--node`: Points to the specific Sei node RPC URL you're connecting to for transaction submission.
- `--no-admin`: Specifies that the contract should not have an admin. This flag is used to indicate that the contract, once deployed, cannot be upgraded or migrated.

<Callout type="info">
  The CW20 Pointer Contract has a code ID of `7` on devnet, and it's pre-stored
  for easy use. To store this contract yourself or to check out the source code,
  please visit our [GitHub
  page](https://github.com/sei-protocol/sei-chain/tree/evm/example/cosmwasm/cw20).
</Callout>

#### For ERC721 Tokens

To deploy an CW721 Pointer Contract that links to a ERC721 token, you can use the following command:

```bash copy
seid tx wasm instantiate 8 '{"erc721_address": "$ERC721_TOKEN_ADDRESS"}' --from=$SENDER --label=$LABEL --chain-id=arctic-1 --broadcast-mode=block --gas=250000 --fees=25000usei --node=https://rpc-arctic-1.sei-apis.com/ --no-admin
```

**Parameters**

- `ERC721_TOKEN_ADDRESS`: The contract address of the ERC721 token you want to create an CW721 pointer for.

**Flags**

- `--from`: The Sei address from which the deployment transaction is sent. This address must have enough balance to cover transaction fees.
- `--label`: A name for the contract instance used to identify the contract.
- `--chain-id`: Identifies the specific chain of the Sei network you're interacting with. `arctic-1` refers to the Sei devnet.
- `--broadcast-mode`: Determines how the transaction is broadcasted. Setting this to `block` means the transaction will wait to be included in a block before returning a response.
- `--gas`: Specifies the maximum amount of gas that can be consumed by the transaction.
- `--fees`: Indicates the transaction fee.
- `--node`: Points to the specific Sei node RPC URL you're connecting to for transaction submission.
- `--no-admin`: Specifies that the contract should not have an admin. This flag is used to indicate that the contract, once deployed, cannot be upgraded or migrated.
